Thousands of devotees arrive from parts of Yadgir, Kalaburagi, Vijayapura, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra to take part in the fair. The ritual has been banned for the past three years by the Yadgir district administration.However, despite the ban, some devotees have continued the practice.

This is practised during the annual fair of Mailapur Mallaiah on the day of Sankranti (January 14) every year.\n\nMembers of the Kuruba community sacrifice the lamb as a gesture of devotion to the deity. Apart from Kurubas, members of Gonda community also participate in the ritual. Keshava Motagi, president of Nandi Animal Welfare Society, Kalaburagi, said the tradition is mere fashion today and is cruelty to animals.\n\n“In this modern era, such practices should be prohibited,” Motagi said. Thousands of devotees arrive from parts of Yadgir, Kalaburagi, Vijayapura, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra to take part in the fair. The ritual has been banned for the past three years by the Yadgir district administration.\n\nHowever, despite the ban, some devotees have continued the practice. This year, six devotees tossed sheep over the palanquin. Police later arrested three people.\n\nStatus: Banned\nOld Mysuru region\nCattle made to jump across fire or Kichchu Haisodu\nKichchu Haisodu is a ritual associated with farming in old Mysuru region.\nThe ritual is observed during Makara Sankranti every year when cattle are made to jump over fire. The cattle - bull and cow - are bathed, their horns painted and decorated. Later in the evening, they are made to jump over the fire. The ritual is still practised in villages around Bengaluru, Mandya, Ramanagara, Mysuru and Hassan. Farmers believe that the practice of making cattle jump over fire will kill small insects present on their body.\n\nStatus: Practised\nHubbali\nRam Fight of Savji Community\nSomavansha Sahasrajun Kshatriya Samaj members also known as Savji community hold ram fights during Dasara. The community has been practising this for hundreds of years. Earlier, such fights were organised in district stadiums. But as crowds swelled, it attracted animal rights activists who vehemently opposed it.\n\nAt present, it is only held in areas where members of the Savji community live, mostly in Dajibanpet and Kamaripet in Hubballi. Organisers say the sport is part of their culture and courts should respect the sentiments of the people. Many Muslim families in Hubballi too organise ram fights annually.\n\nStatus: Banned, illegally practised\nHubbali\nKobri Hori competition\nKobri Hori Sparde translated as catch a running bull is among the state’s most popular rural sport. The event is held during Diwali when farmers, agricultural workers and youngsters try to subdue a bull and then tie dry coconuts around its horns.\n\nThe bulls are then taken in a procession around the village or town. Farmers usually sharpen the animal’s horn before the event. Over the years, stories of competitors losing their lives or suffering injuries has marred the event.\n\nStatus: Banned, illegally practised\nMangaluru, Udupi\nCock fighting or kori katte\nAlthough a banned sport, cock fighting still thrives illegally in parts of Karnataka. However, the scale of the event pales in comparison with Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana where it is a huge betting sport, running to crores. Dakshin Kannada and Udupi districts still follow this age old tradition.\n\nA special breed of cocks/fowls which are known as game cocks are bred and trained for fighting purposes. Blades are tied to the roosters spurs. Farmers engage in this activity before and after harvesting paddy crops.\n\nThe event is held after festivals like Sankranti and Diwali and is organised a few times a year in the vicinity of temples around Mangaluru and Udupi.\n“The sport is held secretively as it is banned by High Courts and the Supreme Court. The cost of roosters varies from 20,000-25,000 while the betting may go up to a few lakhs,” said activist Ravi.\n\nAccording to PeTA India, cock fighting community rear, the roosters and trains them in such a way that these birds become killers.\nStatus: Banned, illegally practised\nNorth Karnataka\nBullock cart racing\nBullock cart racing has been a traditional sport practised for more than hundred years. The event which was widely held across the state is now restricted to parts of north Karnataka. The races are held during Dasara and Diwali. Participants race in bullock carts and winners receive prize money.\n\nStatus: No ban\nUdupi\nBuffalo racing or kambala\nKambala is an annual buffalo race organised by agrarian families after the harvest of Rabi crop. Kambala season lasts from November to March, before the onset of summer when Kolke crop is cultivated. The animals race in paddy fields filled with slush. Locals believe this practice prepares the land for the Kolke crop.\n\nIn the last 50 years, Kambala’s mandate has changed and the folk sport has turned into a money spinner with audiences placing huge bets on the animals. The game has become an organised rural sport with committees setting up schedules and cash prizes.\n\nThe game is conducted across Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and even parts of Kasaragod in Kerala. However, the sport has been put on hold due to an interim ban by the High Court, following opposition by animal rights activists.\n\nPreviously, despite a petition for a ban on the event by People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PeTA), the races were held with regulations issued by local district administration.\nStatus: Interim ban'}

There are two players.\n\nJust like modern chess, Chaturanga has various pieces — the King (Raja), General (Mantri or Senapati), Rook (Ratha), Elephant/Bishop (Gaja), Horse/Knight (Ashva), and Pawn (Padaati or Bhata). Each piece moves in a certain direction.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to get the opponent’s king into trouble so that he cannot move without being taken by the enemy. Kings and generals played this game to gain new ideas about the form of war offensive.\n\n5. Pallankuzhi\n\nIt is believed that this ancient game originated in Tamil Nadu but later spread to other states such as Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, and Karnataka. This game gained popularity even in Sri Lanka and Malaysia. The game is still played in some rural parts of India and is called Kuzhipara, Ali Guli Mane, or Picchala Peeta in different languages.\n\nIn this game, we use a rectangular board that is divided into two rows and seven cups. Players must use 146 counters to put in these cups. These counters are usually cowrie shells or tamarind shells. Each cup contains 12 counters. In the middle row cups, only two counters are placed. There are two players taking turns.\n\nThe starting player picks the counters from any of the holes on their side and assigns a counter to each cup in a counterclockwise direction. Once they reach the end of their cups, they move on to their opponent’s cups. When their counters are over, they pick the counters from the next cup and continue the game. If the last counter falls into a cup with an empty cup beyond, the counters in the next cup are captured by the player. The next player takes over.\n\nThe game continues until the last counter falls in a cup with two empty cups beyond it. The player can capture no more counters, and their turn is over.\n\nIn this intricate game, there are other rules that make it interesting. Although this game is best played between two players, even one person can play the game on a lazy afternoon. Pallankuzhi can be played by both children and adults.\n\n6. Antakshari\n\nAntakshari is one of the most popular traditional Indian games. The game is played widely in social gatherings and weddings. Children play it in their free time at school.

Moksha Patam\n\nMoksha Patam or Parama Padam is a board game that is believed to have been invented in ancient India and has spread to other parts of the world. Now, it is commonly called Snakes and Ladders. In ancient India, it was used as a form of entertainment and to teach morality to children.\n\nThe basic concept is to teach people that the way to reach heaven or “moksha” is to abandon the bondage of passion. The ladder symbolizes the rise from one level of enlightenment to another, while the snake symbolizes immoral behavior and how they lead to degeneration. This game is played by two to four players. The first player to reach the “highest heaven” is the winner.\n\n8. Aadu puli aatam\n\nAadu puli aatam literally means “a game of lambs and tigers.” It is called meka puli aata in Telugu and aadu huli aata in Kannada. This is a two-player game where the tigers hunt goats on an asymmetric grid.\n\nIn this game, first, draw a triangle and divide it into three equal parts. Then, draw a rectangle on the entire triangle, intersecting it throughout. Then divide the rectangle horizontally into two parts. One player has 15 “goats,” and the other player has three “tigers.” Each of these pieces is placed at the intersection point. Tigers try to eat goats, and goats try to actively stop them. The pieces are usually cowrie shells or pebbles.\n\n9. Chowkabara\n\nThis is another four-player game that is similar to Chaupar or Ludo.

Today, many of these events are banned under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, but are widely practised. The protests over the ban on Jallikattu in Tamil Nadu, followed by an ordinance allowing groups to conduct the event has led to demands for revoking the ban on such sports. Express takes a look at traditional sporting events held across state\n\nYadgir - Tossing lambs over palanquin of village deity\nFor over a century, villagers in Mailapur in Yadgir taluk have performed the ritual of tossing lambs over the palanquin of the village deity Mallaiah. This is practised during the annual fair of Mailapur Mallaiah on the day of Sankranti (January 14) every year.\n\nMembers of the Kuruba community sacrifice the lamb as a gesture of devotion to the deity. Apart from Kurubas, members of Gonda community also participate in the ritual. Keshava Motagi, president of Nandi Animal Welfare Society, Kalaburagi, said the tradition is mere fashion today and is cruelty to animals.\n\n“In this modern era, such practices should be prohibited,” Motagi said. Thousands of devotees arrive from parts of Yadgir, Kalaburagi, Vijayapura, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra to take part in the fair. The ritual has been banned for the past three years by the Yadgir district administration.\n\nHowever, despite the ban, some devotees have continued the practice.

The community has been practising this for hundreds of years. Earlier, such fights were organised in district stadiums. But as crowds swelled, it attracted animal rights activists who vehemently opposed it.\n\nAt present, it is only held in areas where members of the Savji community live, mostly in Dajibanpet and Kamaripet in Hubballi. Organisers say the sport is part of their culture and courts should respect the sentiments of the people.

This is a two-player game where the tigers hunt the goats on an asymmetric grid.\nTo set the board, first, draw a triangle and divide it into three equal parts. Then, draw a rectangle on the entire triangle, intersecting it throughout. Then divide the rectangle horizontally into two parts. One player has 15 “goats,” and the other player has three “tigers.” Each of these pieces is placed at the intersection. The tigers try to eat the goats, and the goats try to stop them actively. The pieces are usually cowrie shells or pebbles.\n\n11. Pancha Kone\nThis is a popular Indian traditional game. You can find this game board engraved on ancient temples and monuments all over the country. Pancha Kone means “five corners or five cones”. It is played on a board with five-point stars painted on it. This is a strategy game that requires the player to move the pieces around the board. Chinese Checkers is a game which is based on this ancient game.\n\nIndian Traditional Outdoor Games\nIn addition to indoor games', 'Langdi, Kho-kho, Pallanguzhi, and Lagori are some of the famous traditional Indian games for kids. They are a part of India’s rich heritage, history, and culture. They have been mentioned in many ancient Indian scriptures indicating their existence for many centuries. With the increasing prevalence of video games, online games, and gaming gadgets, these traditional games have lost their importance. However, these games should not be forgotten, and schools may also consider adding them to the curriculum as they include physical exercises and are a lot of fun. They help children improve their motor and social skills. Read this post to know about these and many other indoor and outdoor traditional Indian games.\n\nTraditional Indian Indoor Games\nTraditional Indian indoor games usually require a lot of mental work and improve children’s problem-solving skills. Some of these games have also been adopted by the Western world, and now we know them by their more popular English names.\n\n1. Pachisi/Chaupar\n\nPachisi or Chaupar is a well-known board game since it was the genesis of the Kurukshetra war in Mahabharata. The Mughals were fond of this game, too. Pachisi was traditionally played on a symmetrical cross cloth. On the other hand, Chaupar was a board game invented in the 4th century.\n\nIn both these games, two to four players use cowrie shells and dice to plan their maneuvers and attack opponents. Now, you call this game Ludo, one of the more popular games today. Pachisi or Chaupar is an excellent game to teach your child how to plan and execute.\n\n2. Anchankal/Kallankal\n\nThis game is widely played in Tamil Nadu. As the name of the game suggests, Anchankal is a game composed of five stones. The game improves hand-eye coordination, concentration, memory, and aiming abilities. This is a very engaging game, and the best part is that you can create your own steps.\n\nIn the original game, you use five smooth stones that can be held in your hand. Place the stones on the floor or any flat surface. Pick one stone, toss it in the air, and while that stone is in the air, pick another stone from the ground, while catching the stone tossed in the air before it hits the ground. Repeat this with the rest of the stones.\n\nYou can continue this game by picking up different numbers of stones from the floor, or even throwing a different number of stones into the air, and then picking up other stones before other stones fall. It is important that you should not let the stones tossed in the air fall on the ground. It requires some practice, but once you master it, you can enjoy hours of entertainment.\n\n3. Ashtapada\n\nAshtapada is the predecessor of chess. Just like a chessboard, the Ashtapada board is also divided into an 8×8 square grids but of one color. Ashtapada is a dice game. There are markings on the corners and the center square of the board. These squares are called castles. The pieces on these squares are safe, captured, or removed by the opponents.\n\nEach player starts with an even number of pieces to play the game. The pieces must be moved clockwise around the board to enter the castle on the outer edge. Then they enter the castle in the center in a clockwise direction. This is a game to reach the castle.\n\nAnother variation of Ashtapada is Dasapada that is played on a 10×10 board.\n4. Chaturanga\n\nChaturanga is an ancient strategy game invented in India. It is believed to be the ancestor of strategy games, such as Chess, Xiangqi, Shogi, and Makruk. Chaturanga is mentioned in many ancient scripts. It is played on the Ashtapada board. There are two players.\n\nJust like modern chess, Chaturanga has various pieces — the King (Raja), General (Mantri or Senapati), Rook (Ratha), Elephant/Bishop (Gaja), Horse/Knight (Ashva), and Pawn (Padaati or Bhata). Each piece moves in a certain direction.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to get the opponent’s king into trouble so that he cannot move without being taken by the enemy. Kings and generals played this game to gain new ideas about the form of war offensive.\n\n5. Pallankuzhi\n\nIt is believed that this ancient game originated in Tamil Nadu but later spread to other states such as Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, and Karnataka. This game gained popularity even in Sri Lanka and Malaysia. The game is still played in some rural parts of India and is called Kuzhipara, Ali Guli Mane, or Picchala Peeta in different languages.\n\nIn this game, we use a rectangular board that is divided into two rows and seven cups. Players must use 146 counters to put in these cups. These counters are usually cowrie shells or tamarind shells. Each cup contains 12 counters. In the middle row cups, only two counters are placed. There are two players taking turns.\n\nThe starting player picks the counters from any of the holes on their side and assigns a counter to each cup in a counterclockwise direction. Once they reach the end of their cups, they move on to their opponent’s cups. When their counters are over, they pick the counters from the next cup and continue the game. If the last counter falls into a cup with an empty cup beyond, the counters in the next cup are captured by the player. The next player takes over.\n\nThe game continues until the last counter falls in a cup with two empty cups beyond it. The player can capture no more counters, and their turn is over.\n\nIn this intricate game, there are other rules that make it interesting. Although this game is best played between two players, even one person can play the game on a lazy afternoon. Pallankuzhi can be played by both children and adults.\n\n6. Antakshari\n\nAntakshari is one of the most popular traditional Indian games. The game is played widely in social gatherings and weddings. Children play it in their free time at school. The best thing about this game is that it can also be played in a small space, just like when traveling in a car.\n\nAntakshari is the best way to spend time. You need to have a repertoire of songs to play this game. You can play this game in a team. Each team sings in turns, starting from the last letter of the previous song sung by the other team.\n\n7. Moksha Patam\n\nMoksha Patam or Parama Padam is a board game that is believed to have been invented in ancient India and has spread to other parts of the world. Now, it is commonly called Snakes and Ladders. In ancient India, it was used as a form of entertainment and to teach morality to children.\n\nThe basic concept is to teach people that the way to reach heaven or “moksha” is to abandon the bondage of passion. The ladder symbolizes the rise from one level of enlightenment to another, while the snake symbolizes immoral behavior and how they lead to degeneration. This game is played by two to four players. The first player to reach the “highest heaven” is the winner.\n\n8. Aadu puli aatam\n\nAadu puli aatam literally means “a game of lambs and tigers.” It is called meka puli aata in Telugu and aadu huli aata in Kannada. This is a two-player game where the tigers hunt goats on an asymmetric grid.\n\nIn this game, first, draw a triangle and divide it into three equal parts. Then, draw a rectangle on the entire triangle, intersecting it throughout. Then divide the rectangle horizontally into two parts. One player has 15 “goats,” and the other player has three “tigers.” Each of these pieces is placed at the intersection point. Tigers try to eat goats, and goats try to actively stop them. The pieces are usually cowrie shells or pebbles.\n\n9. Chowkabara\n\nThis is another four-player game that is similar to Chaupar or Ludo. The goal of the game is to achieve home safety without getting removed by the opponents’ pieces. The game is popular all over India and is known under different names, such as Eight and Four, Kattam Kalo, Chauka Baara, Changapoo, Ettu Veedu, Kattam Kazhi, and Aada Sada.\n\n10.

Dr. Ananya Prakash is a renowned cultural anthropologist and heritage scholar specializing in South Indian folk traditions and indigenous games. With over two decades of field research across Karnataka’s rural heartlands, Dr. Prakash has dedicated her career to documenting and reviving the vanishing legacy of traditional Indian games. Her groundbreaking work, *""Playgrounds of the Past: The Living Heritage of Karnataka’s Traditional Games""*, has been lauded for its vivid storytelling, academic rigor, and cultural sensitivity. A recipient of the Sahitya Akademi Youth Fellowship and a visiting fellow at the Indian Institute of Culture and Heritage Studies, Dr. Prakash has worked closely with schools and community organizations to reintroduce age-old games like Chowka Bara, Adu Huli Aata, and Kambala into modern educational and recreational spaces. Her work not only preserves Karnataka’s intangible heritage but also highlights the cognitive, social, and physical benefits of these traditional games in today’s digital age.


  Traditional games have always been a part of Karnataka’s rich culture. There are a variety of indoor, outdoor and board games that were popular in Karnataka. Many of these interesting games were played by both the young and the old.

But with the advent of computers, mobile phones and play stations the concept of playing games have drastically changed in the state along with the rest of the country. Though a few of the traditional games are still played in Karnataka, people dwelling in the cities have lost touch with most of the traditional games.

Let us take a look at some of the traditional games that were once enthusiastically played across Karnataka.
Chinni Dandu (Gilli Danda)
Gilli danda is one of the most popular outdoor games played all over India and even in South Asia. It is called Chinni Dandu in Kannada. This game is believed to be the origin of many European and American games such as Cricket, Baseball and Softball. The game is played with a peg (gilli) and a stick (danda), both of which are made of wood. The stick is used to strike the peg. It is a team game that requires hand eye co-ordination and concentration of the player.

Buguri (Spinning the top)
Spinning the top or Lattu is a fun game played across many parts of India and Pakistan. It is known as Buguri in Kannada. It is an interesting traditional game where a wooden top is made to spin. There are grooves in the lower half of the top and a nail at the bottom to spin on. A string is wrapped around the grooves to deploy the top and make it spin.

Goti (Marbles)
Popularly known as marbles, kancha or goli, it is a much loved gully sport in the country. It is called Goti in Kannada. This classic game requires the player to hit the selected target ‘marble’ using his/her own marble ball. The winner of the game walks away with all the marbles of the other players. This game requires aiming and concentration skills on part of the player.

Kabaddi
Kabbadi is a team sport that originated in ancient India. Two teams occupy opposite halves of an enclosure and each team sends in a raider to the other side in turns. The raider has to tackle members of the opposite team while chanting kabaddi during the raid before he returns to his side of the enclosure. It is a very popular sport that is played not only across India but also in countries like Bangladesh and Maldives.

Kallu Gundu Ettuvudu (Stone Balls)
Kallu Gundu Ettuvudu or Kallata is an outdoor sport of rural Karnataka. It requires the participants to lift round stone balls (called kallu gundu in Kannada) of various sizes and weights. The sport demands that the players be physically strong enough to lift heavy stones.

Pagade
Pagade is a cross and circle board game that is very similar to the ancient game of Pachisi or Chaupad. This game requires 2 or 4 players to race their respective pawns to reach the innermost square.

Snakes & Ladders is a classic board game that originated in ancient India. It is known as Paramapada in Kannada. The game can be played by two or more players on a game-board that has numbered, gridded squares. The board has several ladders and snakes drawn on it. Players have to navigate their game piece from the start to the finish based on die rolls. The ladders help the game piece to progress while the snakes hinder their movement.

Ali Guli Mane
Ali Guli Mane or Channe Mane is a traditional indoor board game of Karnataka. The game is generally played by two players on a wooden board that has 14 pits. The pits are used to store 70 tamarind seeds or cowry shells that act as counters in the game. It is an engaging game that helps to develop logic, hand-eye coordination and concentration.

Lagori (Seven Stones)
A stack of stones, a ball and a focused eye is all you need to play the game of lagori in an open courtyard. This game is quite popular in the North and Eastern states of India and is fondly called pittu, lingochi or palli patti by many. However, it is becoming increasingly popular in Mangalore and a common outdoor norm amongst the youth. The game involves a pile of flat stones and two opposing teams. A player from one team throws the ball at the pile to disrupt it, and runs. The players of the opposite team reach for the ball and run to hit the players of the ball-throwing team who re-make the stack in the meantime without getting hit. It barely makes use of any expensive tools or equipment and is really easy to follow. No wonder it has been gaining heat lately.

Primarily military support against Tenochtitlan and joined the siege (1521).|History of Mexico|Timeline|Mexico portalThe Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, also known as the Conquest of Mexico, the Spanish-Aztec War (1519–1521),[7] or the Conquest of Tenochtitlan was one of the primary events in the Spanish colonization of the Americas. There are multiple 16th-century narratives of the events by Spanish conquistadors, their indigenous allies, and the defeated Aztecs. It was not solely a small contingent of Spaniards defeating the Aztec Empire but a coalition of Spanish invaders with tributaries to the Aztecs, and most especially the Aztecs\' indigenous enemies and rivals. They combined forces to defeat the Mexica of Tenochtitlan over a two-year period. For the Spanish, Mexico was part of a project of Spanish colonization of the New World after 25 years of permanent Spanish settlement and further exploration in the Caribbean.Significant events in the conquest of Mesoamerica[edit]Historical sources for the conquest of Mesoamerica recount some of the same events in both Spanish and indigenous sources. Others, however, are unique to a particular primary source or group narrating the event. Individuals and groups laud their own accomplishments, while often denigrating or ignoring those of their opponents or their allies or both.Following an earlier expedition to Yucatán led by Juan de Grijalva in 1518, Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés led an expedition (entrada) to Mexico. The next year, Cortés and his retinue set sail for Mexico.[8] The Spanish campaign against the Aztec Empire had its final victory on 13 August 1521, when a coalition army of Spanish forces and native Tlaxcalan warriors led by Cortés and Xicotencatl the Younger captured the emperor Cuauhtémoc and Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec Empire. The fall of Tenochtitlan marks the beginning of Spanish rule in central Mexico, and they established their capital of Mexico City on the ruins of Tenochtitlan.Cortés made alliances with tributary city-states (altepetl) of the Aztec Empire as well as their political rivals, particularly the Tlaxcaltecs and Tetzcocans, a former partner in the Aztec Triple Alliance. Other city-states also joined, including Cempoala and Huejotzingo and polities bordering Lake Texcoco, the inland lake system of the Valley of Mexico. Particularly important to the Spanish success was a multilingual (Nahuatl, a Maya dialect, and Spanish) Nahua-speaking woman enslaved by the Mayas, known to the Spanish conquistadors as Doña Marina, and later as La Malinche. After eight months of battles and negotiations, which overcame the diplomatic resistance of the Aztec Emperor Moctezuma II to his visit, Cortés arrived in Tenochtitlan on 8 November 1519, where he took up residence with fellow Spaniards and their indigenous allies. When news reached Cortés of the death of several of his men during the Aztec attack on the Totonacs in Veracruz, Cortés claims that he took Motecuhzoma captive. Capturing the cacique or indigenous ruler was a standard operating procedure for Spaniards in their expansion in the Caribbean, so capturing Motecuhzoma had considerable precedent but modern scholars are skeptical that Cortés and his countrymen took Motecuhzoma captive at this time. They had great incentive to claim they did, owing to the laws of Spain at this time, but critical analysis of their personal writings suggest Motecuhzoma was not taken captive until a much later date.[9]When Cortés left Tenochtitlan to return to the coast and deal with the threat of the expedition of Pánfilo de Narváez, Cortés left Pedro de Alvarado in charge of Tenochtitlan. Cortés left with a small army to the coast with the plan of attacking during the night. After defeating Narváez\'s fleet, Cortés convinced most of his enemy\'s crew to go with him by promising great riches. Upon reaching Tenochtitlan, Cortés and the new enlarged force received the message that ""the Aztec had risen against the Spanish garrison"" during a religious celebration.[10] Alvarado ordered his army to attack the unarmed crowd; he later claims that the Aztecs had used the celebration to cover up a counterattack. Cortés realized that the defeat was imminent and decided to escape yet, the Aztecs attacked. The Massacre is most known as the Noche Triste (the sorrowful night) about ""400 Spaniards, 4000 native allies and many horses [were killed] before reaching the mainland"".[10] Moctezuma was killed, although the sources do not agree on who killed him.[11] According to one account, when Moctezuma, now seen by the population as a mere puppet of the invading Spaniards, attempted to calm the outraged populace, he was killed by a projectile.[12] According to an indigenous account, the Spanish killed Moctezuma.[13] Cortés had returned to Tenochtitlan and his men fled the capital city during the Noche Triste in June 1520. The Spanish, Tlaxcalans and reinforcements returned a year later on 13 August 1521 to a civilization that had been weakened by famine and smallpox. This made it easier to conquer the remaining Aztecs.[14] The Spaniards\' victory is attributed to their help from indigenous allies, technology, and the Aztec empire\'s vulnerability due to the smallpox spread. As a result, the Aztec\'s tactics countering the Spaniard\'s advanced technology is understated. According to Hassig, ""It is true that cannons, guns, crossbows, steel blades, horses and war dogs were advanced on the Aztecs\' weaponry. But the advantage these gave a few hundred Spanish soldiers was not overwhelming.""[15] In the words of Restall, ""Spanish weapons were useful for breaking the offensive lines of waves of indigenous warriors, but this was no formula for conquest ... rather, it was a formula for survival, until Spanish and indigenous reinforcements arrived.""[7]The integration of the indigenous allies, essentially, those from Tlaxcala and Texcoco, into the Spanish army played a crucial role in the conquest, yet other factors paved the path for the Spaniards\' success. For instance, the Spaniards\' timing of entry, the compelling ideologies of both groups, and the Spanish unfamiliarity with the Aztec Empire. Therefore, the Spaniards lacked a sense of danger and power structure within the empire. ""A direct attack on a city as mighty as Tenochtitlan was unlikely and unexpected"" from the enemy empires. As well, it was very uncommon that an attacking army would come unannounced.[15] In addition, aside from the infantry and the allies\' role in the Spanish conquest, cavalry was the ""arm of decision in the conquest"" and ""the key ingredient in the Spanish forces"".[16]Many of those on the Cortés expedition of 1519 had never seen combat before, including Cortés. A whole generation of Spaniards later participated in expeditions in the Caribbean and Tierra Firme (Central America), learning strategy and tactics of successful enterprises. The Spanish conquest of Mexico had antecedents with established practices.[17]The fall of the Aztec Empire was the key event in the formation of the Spanish Empire overseas, with New Spain, which later became Mexico.Timeline[edit]- 1428 – Creation of the Triple Alliance of Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan- 1492–93 – Columbus reaches the Caribbean; start of permanent Spanish settlements- 1493–1515 – Spanish exploration, conquest, enslavement, and settlement in the Caribbean and the Spanish Main- 1502 – Moctezuma II elected huey tlatoani, emperor [literally: ""Great Speaker""] of the Aztec Triple Alliance- 1503–09 – Moctezuma\'s coronation conquests- 1504 – Hernan Cortés arrives in the Caribbean- 1511– Spanish viceroy in the Caribbean appoints Diego Velázquez to conquer and govern Cuba- 1510~ Francisco Vazquez de Coronado was born- 1515 – Texcocan monarch Nezahualpilli dies; Cacamatzin succeeds to the throne; the rebellion of Ixtlilxochitl- 1517 – Expedition of Francisco Hernández de Córdoba to the Yucatán coast- 1517- City of Cholollan secedes from Tlaxcalteca Alliance, becomes a tributary state of the Aztec Triple Alliance- 1518 – Expedition of Juan de Grijalva to the Yucatán and Gulf coasts; appointment of Cortés to lead a third exploratory expedition1519- 10 February – Cortés expedition leaves Cuba, taking Hernández de Córdoba\'s route.

The massacre broke out for disputed reasons, perhaps to quash an impending Cholulan attack[27] or to fulfill a Tlaxcalteca plan to both exact revenge on Cholollan for its secession and to test their new Spanish allies.[7]- 8 November 1519 – Meeting of Cortés and Moctezuma1520- April or May – Pánfilo de Narváez arrives on the Gulf coast, sent by Governor Velázquez to rein in Cortés- Mid-May – Pedro de Alvarado massacres Aztec elites celebrating the Festival of Toxcatl- Late May – Cortés forces attack Narvárez\'s forces at Cempoala; incorporation of those Spaniards into Cortés\'s forces- 24 June – Spanish forces return to Tenochtitlan- Late June – Uprising in Tenochtitlan; the death of Moctezuma in unclear circumstances, perhaps killed by the Spaniards, perhaps by his own people; deaths of other leaders of the Triple Alliance- 30 June – ""La Noche Triste"" – Evacuation of Spanish-Tlaxcalteca allied forces from Tenochtitlan; deaths of perhaps 1,000 Spaniards and 1,000 Tlaxcalans- 9 or 10 July – Battle of Otumba, Aztec forces attack the Spanish-Tlaxcalteca forces at Otumba- 11 or 12 July – Retreat to Tlaxcala- 1 August – Spanish punitive expedition in Tepeaca in reprisal for the murder of Spaniards by its inhabitants.[28]- Mid-September – Coronation of Cuitlahuac as Moctezuma\'s successor- Mid-October to mid-December – Smallpox epidemic; death of Cuitlahuac on 4 December, perhaps of smallpox- Late December – Spanish-Tlaxcaltec forces return to the Valley of Mexico; join with Texcoca forces of Ixtlilxochitl1521- Late January – Cuauhtemoc elected huey tlatoani of Tenochtitlan- February – Combined Spanish-Tlaxcalteca-Texcoca forces attack Xaltocan and Tlacopan; Texcoco becomes the base of operations for the campaign against Tenochtitlan- Early April – Attacks against Yautepec and Cuernavaca, following by sacking- Mid-April – Combined forces defeated by the Xochimilcans, Tenochtitlan\'s ally- Late April – Construction of 13 shallow-bottomed brigantines by Tlaxcalteca laborers under Spanish supervision; mounted with cannon; launched into Lake Texcoco, allowing Spanish control of the inland sea- 10 May – Start of the siege of Tenochtitlan; potable water from Chapultepec cut off- 30 June – Defeat of Spanish-Tlaxcalteca forces on a causeway; capture and ritual sacrifice of the Spaniards and their horses in Tenochtitlan- July – Spanish ships land at Veracruz with large numbers of Spaniards, munitions, and horses- 20–25 July – Battle for Tenochtitlan- 1 August – Spanish-Tlaxcalan-Texcocan forces enter the Plaza Mayor; last stand of the Aztec defenders- 13 August – Surrender of Aztec defenders; capture of Cuauhtemoc- 13–17 August – Wholesale sacking and violence against the survivors in Tenochtitlan1522- October – Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor names Cortés captain-general of New Spain, the Spanish name for central Mexico.- November – Death of Cortés\'s wife, Catalina Suárez, in Coyoacan, where Cortés was resident while the new capital Mexico City was constructed on the ruins of Tenochtitlan- Cortés\'s Second Letter to the crown is published in Seville, Spain1524- Arrival of the first twelve Franciscan missionaries to Mexico, beginning of the ""spiritual conquest"" to convert the indigenous populations to Christianity[29]- Conqueror Cristóbal de Olid\'s expedition to Honduras; renounces Cortés\' authority; Cortés expedition to Honduras with the captive Cuauhtemoc1525- February – execution of the three rulers of the former Triple Alliance, including Cuauhtemoc- Don Juan Velázquez Tlacotzin, former ""viceroy"" (cihuacoatl) appointed governor of the indigenous sector of Mexico City1525–301527–1547Sources for the conquest of Mesoamerica[edit]The conquest of Mexico, the initial destruction of the great pre-Columbian civilizations, is a significant event in world history. The conquest was well documented by a variety of sources with differing points of view, including indigenous accounts, by both allies and opponents. Accounts by the Spanish conquerors exist from the first landfall at Veracruz, Mexico (on Good Friday, 22 April 1519) to the final victory over the Mexica in Tenochtitlan on 13 August 1521. Notably, the accounts of the conquest, Spanish and indigenous alike, have biases and exaggerations. Some, though not all, Spanish accounts downplay the support of their indigenous allies. Conquerors\' accounts exaggerate individual contributions to the Conquest at the expense of their comrades, while indigenous allies\' accounts stress their loyalty and importance to victory for the Spanish. These accounts are similar to Spanish conquerors\' accounts contained in petitions for rewards, known as benemérito petitions.[30]Two lengthy accounts from the defeated indigenous viewpoint were created under the direction of Spanish friars, Franciscan Bernardino de Sahagún and Dominican Diego Durán, using indigenous informants.[31]Because Nahuatl did not have a full alphabet, the majority of extant indigenous sources are recollections of Nahuatl-speakers who were subsequently introduced to Latin characters after the arrival of the Spanish. Gingerish[32] identifies the Annals of Tlatelolco (1524?-1528) as “One of the oldest recorded manuscripts in Nahuatl, written presumably by a native who must have learned the use of Latin characters and alphabet within three or four years of the conquest.”Lockhart,[33] however, argues for a later post-1540 date for this manuscript, and indeed the majority of indigenous source material was recorded a generation or more after the events through interaction with and under influence of Spanish priests. As noted in,[32] “No ‘pure’ Nahuatl text exists-with the exception of a few pre- Cortesian pictographic codices. Every written Nahuatl text was recorded after 1521 either directly by a Christian priest, by students who worked directly under priestly supervision, or by former students who had studied in Christian schools long enough to understand the necessity of the new religion. The written language was a personal possession of the noble and priestly class.”The first Spanish account of the conquest was written by lead conqueror Hernán Cortés, who sent a series of letters to the Spanish monarch Charles V, giving a contemporary account of the conquest from his point of view, in which he justified his actions. These were almost immediately published in Spain and later in other parts of Europe. Much later, Spanish conqueror Bernal Díaz del Castillo, a well-seasoned participant in the conquest of Central Mexico, wrote what he called The True History of the Conquest of New Spain, countering the account by Cortés\'s official biographer, Francisco López de Gómara. Bernal Díaz\'s account had begun as a benemérito petition for rewards but he expanded it to encompass a full history of his earlier expeditions in the Caribbean and Tierra Firme and the conquest of the Aztec. A number of lower rank Spanish conquerors wrote benemérito petitions to the Spanish Crown, requesting rewards for their services in the conquest, including Juan Díaz, Andrés de Tapia, García del Pilar, and Fray Francisco de Aguilar.[34] Cortés\'s right-hand man, Pedro de Alvarado did not write at any length about his actions in the New World, and died as a man of action in the Mixtón War in 1542. Two letters to Cortés about Alvarado\'s campaigns in Guatemala are published in The Conquistadors.[35]The chronicle of the so-called ""Anonymous Conqueror"" was written sometime in the sixteenth century, entitled in an early twentieth-century translation to English as Narrative of Some Things of New Spain and of the Great City of Temestitan (i.e. Tenochtitlan). Rather than it being a petition for rewards for services, as many Spanish accounts were, the Anonymous Conqueror made observations about the indigenous situation at the time of the conquest. The account was used by eighteenth-century Jesuit Francisco Javier Clavijero in his descriptions of the history of Mexico.[36]On the indigenous side, the allies of Cortés, particularly the Tlaxcalans, wrote extensively about their services to the Spanish Crown in the conquest, arguing for special privileges for themselves. The most important of these are the pictorial Lienzo de Tlaxcala(1585) and the Historia de Tlaxcala by Diego Muñoz Camargo. Less successfully, the Nahua allies from Huexotzinco (or Huejotzinco) near Tlaxcala argued that their contributions had been overlooked by the Spanish. In a letter in Nahuatl to the Spanish Crown, the indigenous lords of Huexotzinco lay out their case in for their valorous service. The letter has been published in Nahuatl and English translation by James Lockhart in We People Here: Nahuatl Accounts of the Conquest of Mexico in 1991.[37] Texcoco patriot and member of a noble family there, Fernando Alva Ixtlilxochitl, likewise petitioned the Spanish Crown, in Spanish, saying that Texcoco had not received sufficient rewards for their support of the conquistadors, particularly after the Spanish were forced out of Tenochtitlan.[38]The best-known indigenous account of the conquest is Book 12 of Bernardino de Sahagún\'s General History of the Things of New Spain and published as the Florentine Codex, in parallel columns of Nahuatl and Spanish, with pictorials. Less well-known is Sahagún\'s 1585 revision of the conquest account, which shifts from the indigenous viewpoint entirely and inserts at crucial junctures passages lauding the Spanish and in particular Hernán Cortés.[39] Another indigenous account compiled by a Spanish friar is Dominican Diego Durán\'s The History of the Indies of New Spain, from 1581, with many color illustrations.[40]A text from the Nahua point of view, the Anales de Tlatelolco, an early indigenous account in Nahuatl, perhaps from 1540, remained in indigenous hands until it was published.[when?] An extract of this important manuscript was published in 1991 by James Lockhart in Nahuatl transcription and English translation.[41] A popular anthology in English for classroom use is Miguel León-Portilla\'s, The Broken Spears: The Aztec Accounts of the Conquest of Mexico from 1992.[42] Not surprisingly, many publications and republications of sixteenth-century accounts of the conquest of Mexico appeared around 1992, the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus\'s first voyage, when scholarly and popular interest in first encounters surged.A popular and enduring narrative of the Spanish campaign in central Mexico is by New England-born nineteenth-century historian William Hickling Prescott. His History of the Conquest of Mexico, first published in 1843, remains an important unified narrative synthesis of the conquest. Prescott read and used all the formal writings from the sixteenth century, although few had been published by the mid-nineteenth century when he was writing. It is likely that a 1585 revision of Bernardino de Sahagún\'s account of the conquest survives today only in the form of a copy because it was made in Spain for Prescott\'s project from a now-lost original.[43] Although scholars of the modern era point out its biases and shortcomings, ""there is nowhere they can get as good a unified narrative of the main events, crises, and course of the Mexican conquest as Prescott\'s version.""[44]Aztec omens for the conquest[edit]In the sources recorded by Franciscan Bernardino de Sahagún and Dominican Diego Durán in the mid to late sixteenth century, there are accounts of events that were interpreted as supernatural omens of the conquest. These two accounts are full-blown narratives from the viewpoint of the Spanish opponents. Most first-hand accounts about the conquest of the Aztec Empire were written by Spaniards: Hernán Cortés\' letters to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and the first-person narrative of Bernal Díaz del Castillo, The True History of the Conquest of New Spain. The primary sources from the native people affected as a result of the conquest are seldom used, because they tend to reflect the views of a particular native group, such as the Tlaxcalans. Indigenous accounts were written in pictographs as early as 1525. Later accounts were written in the native tongue of the Aztec and other native peoples of central Mexico, Nahuatl.The native texts of the defeated Mexica narrating their version of the conquest describe eight omens that were believed to have occurred nine years prior to the arrival of the Spanish from the Gulf of Mexico.[45]In 1510, Aztec Emperor Moctezuma II was visited by Nezahualpilli, who had a reputation as a great seer, as well as being the tlatoani of Texcoco. Nezahualpilli warned Moctezuma that he must be on guard, for in a few years Aztec cities would be destroyed. Before leaving, he said that there would be omens for Moctezuma to know that what he has been told is true. Over the years, and especially after Nezhualpilli\'s death in 1515, several supernatural omens appeared.[46]The eight bad omens or wonders:[42]: 3–11- A column of fire that appeared from midnight until dawn, and seemed to rain fire in the year 1517 (12-House)- Fire consuming the temple of Huitzilopochtli- A lightning bolt destroying the straw temple of Xiuhtecuhtli- The appearance of fire, or comets, streaming across the sky in threes during the day- The ""boiling deep,"" and water flooding, of a lake nearby Tenochtitlan- A woman, Cihuatcoatl, weeping in the middle of the night for them (the Aztecs) to ""flee far away from this city""- Montezuma II saw the stars of mamalhuatztli, and images of fighting men riding ""on the backs of animals resembling deer"", in a mirror on the crown of a bird caught by fishermen- A two headed man, tlacantzolli, running through the streetsAdditionally, the Tlaxcala saw a ""radiance that shone in the east every morning three hours before sunrise"", and a ""whirlwind of dust"" from the volcano Matlalcueye.[42]: 11 According to Diaz, ""These Caciques also told us of a tradition they had heard from their ancestors, that one of the idols which they particularly worshipped had prophesied the coming of men from distant lands in the direction of the sunrise, who would conquer them and rule them.""[47]: 181 Some accounts would claim that this idol or deity was Quetzalcoatl, and that the Aztecs were defeated because they believed the Spanish were supernatural and didn\'t know how to react, although whether or not the Aztecs really believed that is debatable.[48]Omens were extremely important to the Aztecs, who believed that history repeated itself. A number of modern scholars cast doubt on whether such omens occurred or whether they were ex post facto (retrospective) creations to help the Mexica explain their defeat.[49] Some scholars contend that ""the most likely interpretation of the story of these portents is that some, if not all, had occurred"" but concede that it is very likely that ""clever Mexicans and friars, writing later of the Mexican empire, were happy to link those memories with what they know occurred in Europe.[50]Many sources depicting omens and the return of old Aztec gods, including those supervised by Spanish priests, were written after the fall of Tenochtitlan in 1521. Some ethnohistorians say that when the Spanish arrived native peoples and their leaders did not view them as supernatural in any sense but rather as simply another group of powerful outsiders.[51] According to some historians, Moctezuma responded rationally to the Spanish invasion. These historians believe this means that Moctezuma did not think the Spanish were supernatural.[48] Many Spanish accounts incorporated omens to emphasize what they saw as the preordained nature of the conquest and their success as Spanish destiny. This means that native emphasis on omens and bewilderment in the face of invasion ""may be a postconquest interpretation by informants who wished to please the Spaniards or who resented the failure of Montezuma and of the warriors of Tenochtitlan to provide leadership.""[52] Hugh Thomas concludes that Moctezuma was confused and ambivalent about whether Cortés was a god or the ambassador of a great king in another land.[53] Because the Spaniards arrived in 1519, Moctezuma knew this was the year of Ce Acatl, which is the year Quetzalcoatl was promised to return. Previously, during Juan de Grijalva\'s expedition, Moctezuma believed that those men were heralds of Quetzalcoatl, as Moctezuma, as well as everyone else in the Aztec Empire, were to believe that eventually, Quetzalcoatl will return. Moctezuma even had glass beads that were left behind by Grijalva brought to Tenochtitlan and they were regarded as sacred religious relics.[54]Spanish expeditions[edit]The Spanish had established a permanent settlement on the island of Hispaniola in 1493 on the second voyage of Christopher Columbus. There were further Spanish explorations and settlements in the Caribbean and the Spanish Main, seeking wealth in the form of gold and access to indigenous labor to mine gold and other manual labor. Twenty-five years after the first Spanish settlement in the New World, expeditions of exploration were sent to the coast of Mexico.[citation needed]Early Spanish expeditions to Yucatán[edit]In 1517, Cuban governor Diego Velázquez commissioned a fleet of three ships under the command of Hernández de Córdoba to sail west and explore the Yucatán peninsula. Córdoba reached the coast of Yucatán. The Mayans at Cape Catoche invited the Spanish to land, and the conquistadors read the Requirement of 1513 to them, which offered the natives the protection of the King of Spain, if they would submit to him. Córdoba took two prisoners, who adopted the baptized names of Melchor and Julián and became interpreters. Later, the two prisoners, being misled or misinterpreting the language gave information to the Spanish conquistadors that there was plenty of gold up for grabs.[8] On the western side of the Yucatán Peninsula, the Spanish were attacked at night by Maya chief Mochcouoh, a battle in which 50 men were killed. Córdoba was mortally wounded and only a remnant of his crew returned to Cuba.[47]: 15–26At that time, Yucatán was briefly explored by the conquistadors, but the Spanish conquest of Yucatán with its many independent city-state polities of the Late Postclassic Maya civilization came many years after the Spaniards\' and their loyal indigenous allies\' rapid conquest of Central Mexico (1519–21). With the help of tens of thousands of Xiu Mayan warriors, it would take more than 170 years for the Spanish to establish full control of the Maya homelands, which extended from northern Yucatán to the central lowlands region of El Petén and the southern Guatemalan highlands. The end of this latter campaign is generally marked by the downfall of the Maya state based at Tayasal in the Petén region, in 1697.Cortés\'s expedition[edit]Commissioning the expedition[edit]Even before Juan de Grijalva returned to Spain, Velázquez decided to send a third and even larger expedition to explore the Mexican coast.[55] Hernán Cortés, then one of Velázquez\'s favorites and brother-in-law, was named as the commander, which created envy and resentment among the Spanish contingent in the Spanish colony.[55] Licenses for expeditions allowed the Crown to retain sovereignty over newly conquered lands while not risking its own assets in the enterprise. Anyone willing to make a financial contribution could potentially gain even more wealth and power. Men who brought horses, caballeros, received two shares of the spoils, one for military service, another because of the horse.[56] Cortés invested a considerable part of his personal fortune and probably went into debt to borrow additional funds. Velázquez may have personally contributed nearly half the cost of the expedition.In an agreement signed on 23 October 1518, Governor Velázquez restricted the expedition led by Cortés to exploration and trade, so that conquest and settlement of the mainland might occur under his own command, once he had received the permission necessary to do so which he had already requested from the Crown. In this way, Velázquez sought to ensure title to the riches and laborers discovered.[57] However, armed with the knowledge of Castilian law that he had likely gained as a notary in Valladolid, Cortés managed to free himself of Velázquez\'s authority by presenting Velázquez as a tyrant acting in his own self-interest, and not in the interest of the Crown.[58] The men under Cortés also named him military leader and chief magistrate (judge) of the expedition.Revoking the commission[edit]Velázquez himself must have been keenly aware that whoever conquered the mainland for Spain would gain fame, glory and fortune to eclipse anything that could be achieved in Cuba. Thus, as the preparations for departure drew to a close, the governor became suspicious that Cortés would be disloyal to him and try to commandeer the expedition for his own purposes,[59] namely to establish himself as governor of the colony, independent of Velázquez\'s control.Therefore, Velázquez sent Luis de Medina with orders to replace Cortés. However, Cortés\'s brother-in-law allegedly had Medina intercepted and killed. The papers that Medina had been carrying were sent to Cortés. Thus warned, Cortés accelerated the organization and preparation of his expedition.[60]Velázquez arrived at the dock in Santiago de Cuba in person, ""he and Cortés again embraced, with a great exchange of compliments"", before Cortés set sail for Trinidad, Cuba. Velázquez then sent orders for the fleet to be held and Cortés taken prisoner. Nevertheless, Cortés set sail, beginning his expedition with the legal status of a mutineer.[47]: 49, 51, 55–56Cortés\'s contingent consisted of 11 ships carrying about 630 men (including 30 crossbowmen and 12 arquebusiers, an early form of firearm), a doctor, several carpenters, at least eight women, a few hundred Arawaks from Cuba and some Africans, both freedmen and slaves. Although modern usage often calls the European participants ""soldiers"", the term was never used by these men themselves in any context, something that James Lockhart realized when analyzing sixteenth-century legal records from conquest-era Peru.[61]Cortés gains two translators[edit]Cortés spent some time at the island of Cozumel, on the east coast of Yucatán, trying to convert the locals to Christianity, something that provided mixed results. While at Cozumel, Cortés heard reports of other white men living in the Yucatán. Cortés sent messengers to these reported Spaniards, who turned out to be the survivors of a Spanish shipwreck that had occurred in 1511, Gerónimo de Aguilar and Gonzalo Guerrero.Aguilar petitioned his Maya chieftain to be allowed to join his former countrymen, and he was released and made his way to Cortés\'s ships. Now quite fluent in Maya, as well as some other indigenous languages, proved to be a valuable asset for Cortés as a translator – a skill of particular significance to the later conquest of the Aztec Empire that was to be the result of Cortés\'s expedition. According to Bernal Díaz, Aguilar relayed that before coming, he had attempted to convince Guerrero to leave as well. Guerrero declined on the basis that he was by now well-assimilated with the Maya culture, had a Maya wife and three children, and he was looked upon as a figure of rank within the Maya state of Chetumal, where he lived.[62] Although Guerrero\'s later fate is somewhat uncertain, it appears that for some years he continued to fight alongside the Maya forces against Spanish incursions, providing military counsel and encouraging resistance; it is speculated that he may have been killed in a later battle.After leaving Cozumel, Cortés continued round the tip of the Yucatán Peninsula and landed at Potonchán, where there was little gold. After defeating the local natives in two battles, he discovered a far more valuable asset in the form of a woman whom Cortés would have christened Marina. She is often known as La Malinche and also sometimes called ""Malintzin"" or Malinalli.[63] Later, the Aztecs would come to call Cortés ""Malintzin"" or La Malinche by dint of his close association with her.[64] Bernal Díaz del Castillo wrote in his account The True History of the Conquest of New Spain that Marina was ""truly a great princess"". Later, the honorific Spanish title of doña would be added to her baptized name.[47]: 80, 82Cortés had stumbled upon one of the keys to realizing his ambitions. He would speak to Gerónimo de Aguilar in Spanish who would then translate into Mayan for Marina. She would then translate from Mayan to Nahuatl. With this pair of translators, Cortés could now communicate to the Aztecs.[47]: 86–87 How effectively is still a matter of speculation, since Marina did not speak the dialect of the Aztecs, nor was she familiar with the protocols of the Aztec nobility, who were renowned for their flowery, flattering talk. Doña Marina quickly learned Spanish, and became Cortés\'s primary interpreter, confidant, consort, cultural translator, and the mother of his first son, Martin.[47]: 82 Until Cortés\'s marriage to his second wife, a union which produced a legitimate son whom he also named Martin, Cortés\'s natural son with Marina was the heir of his envisaged fortunes.Native speakers of Nahuatl would call her ""Malintzin"". This name is the closest approximation possible in Nahuatl to the sound of Spanish Marina. Over time, ""La Malinche"" (the modern Spanish cognate of Malintzin) became a term for a traitor to one\'s people. To this day, the word malinchista is used by Mexicans to denote one who apes the language and customs of another country.[65][66] It would not be until the late 20th century that a few feminist writers and academics in Mexico would attempt to rehabilitate La Malinche as a woman who made the best of her situation and became, in many respects, a powerful woman.[67]Foundation of Veracruz[edit]Cortés landed his expedition force on the coast of the modern day state of Veracruz in April 1519. During this same period, soon after he arrived, Cortés was welcomed by representatives of the Aztec Emperor, Moctezuma II. Gifts were exchanged, and Cortés attempted to frighten the Aztec delegation with a display of his firepower.[42]: 26 [47]: 89–91Faced with imprisonment or death for defying the governor, Cortés\' only alternative was to continue his enterprise in the hope of redeeming himself and his men with the Spanish Crown. To do this, his men established a settlement called La Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz, or ""True Cross"", since they arrived on Maundy Thursday and landed on Good Friday. The legally constituted ""town council of Villa Rica"" then promptly offered him the position of adelantado, or Chief Justice and Captain-General.[47]: 102This strategy was not unique.[68] Velásquez had used this same legal mechanism to free himself from Diego Columbus\' authority in Cuba. In being named adelantado by a duly constituted cabildo, Cortés was able to free himself from Velásquez\'s authority and continue his expedition. To ensure the legality of this action, several members of his expedition, including Francisco Montejo and Alonso Hernandez Puertocarrero, returned to Spain to seek acceptance of the cabildo\'s declaration with King Charles.[47]: 127–28Cortés learned of an indigenous settlement called Cempoala and marched his forces there. On their arrival in Cempoala, they were greeted by 20 dignitaries and cheering townsfolk.[47]: 88, 107 Cortés quickly persuaded the Totonac chiefs to rebel against the Aztecs, taking prisoner five of Moctezuma\'s tax collectors.[47]: 111–13 The Totonacs also helped Cortés build the town of Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz, which was the starting point for his attempt to conquer the Aztec Empire.[47]: 114Hearing of the rebellion, more ambassadors from the Aztec Emperor returned to see Cortés, bearing gifts of ""gold and cloth"", in thankfulness for Cortés freeing his tax collectors. Moctezuma also told Cortés, he was certain the Spanish were of ""his own race"" and had arrived as ""his ancestors had foretold"". As Cortés told his men, the natives ""think of us as gods, or godlike beings.""[42]: 13, 21, 25, 33, 35 [47]: 115–17Although they attempted to dissuade Cortés from visiting Tenochtitlan, the lavish gifts and the polite, welcoming remarks only encouraged El Caudillo to continue his march towards the capital of the empire.[47]: 96, 166Scuttling the fleet and aftermath[edit]Men still loyal to the governor of Cuba planned to seize a ship and escape to Cuba, but Cortés moved swiftly to squash their plans. Two leaders were condemned to be hanged; two were lashed, and one had his foot mutilated. To make sure such a mutiny did not happen again, he decided to scuttle his ships.[47]: 128–30There is a popular misconception that the ships were burned rather than sunk. This misconception has been attributed to the reference made by Cervantes de Salazár in 1546, as to Cortés burning his ships.[69] This may have also come from a mistranslation of the version of the story written in Latin.[70]With all of his ships scuttled, Cortés effectively stranded the expedition in central Mexico. However, it did not completely end the aspirations of those members of his company who remained loyal to the governor of Cuba. Cortés then led his band inland towards Tenochtitlan.In addition to the Spaniards, Cortés\' force now included 40 Cempoalan warrior chiefs and at least 200 other natives whose task was to drag the cannon and carry supplies.[47]: 134 The Cempoalans were accustomed to the hot climate of the coast, but they suffered immensely from the cold of the mountains, the rain, and the hail as they marched towards Tenochtitlan.Alliance with Tlaxcala[edit]Cortés soon arrived at Tlaxcala, a confederacy of about 200 towns and different tribes, but without central government.The Otomi initially, and then the Tlaxcalans, fought the Spanish in a series of three battles from 2 to 5 September 1519, and at one point Diaz remarked, ""they surrounded us on every side"". After Cortés continued to release prisoners with messages of peace, and realizing the Spanish were enemies of Moctezuma, Xicotencatl the Elder and Maxixcatzin persuaded the Tlaxcalan warleader, Xicotencatl the Younger, that it would be better to ally with the newcomers than to kill them.[47]: 143–55, 171The Tlaxcalans\' main city was Tlaxcala. After almost a century of fighting the Flower Wars, a great deal of hatred and bitterness had developed between the Tlaxcalans and the Aztecs. The Aztecs had already conquered most of the territory around Tlaxcala, and waged war on them every year.[47]: 154 It has been suggested that the Aztecs left Tlaxcala independent so that they would have a constant supply of war captives to sacrifice to their gods.[71]On 23 September 1519, Cortés arrived in Tlaxcala and was greeted with joy by the rulers, who saw the Spanish as an ally against the Aztecs. Due to a commercial blockade by the Aztecs, Tlaxcala was poor, lacking, among other things, salt and cotton cloths, so they could only offer Cortés and his men food and slaves. Cortés stayed twenty days in Tlaxcala, giving his men time to recover from their wounds from the battles. Cortés seems to have won the true friendship and loyalty of the senior leaders of Tlaxcala, among them Maxixcatzin and Xicotencatl the Elder, although he could not win the heart of Xicotencatl the Younger. The Spaniards agreed to respect parts of the city, like the temples, and reportedly took only the things that were offered to them freely.[47]: 172–74As before with other native groups, Cortés preached to the Tlaxcalan leaders about the benefits of Christianity. The Caciques gave Cortés ""the most beautiful of their daughters and nieces"". Xicotencatl the Elder\'s daughter was baptized as Doña Luisa, and Maxixcatzin\'s daughter as Doña Elvira. They were given by Cortés to Pedro de Alvarado and Juan Velázquez de León respectively.[47]: 176–78Legends say that he convinced the four leaders of Tlaxcala to become baptized. Maxixcatzin, Xicotencatl the Elder, Citalpopocatzin, and Temiloltecutl received the names of Don Lorenzo, Don Vicente, Don Bartolomé, and Don Gonzalo. It is impossible to know if these leaders understood the Catholic faith. In any case, they apparently had no problems in adding the Christian ""Dios"" (God in Spanish), the lord of the heavens, to their already complex pantheon of gods. An exchange of gifts was made and thus began the highly significant and effective alliance between Cortés and Tlaxcala.[72]Cortés marches to Cholula[edit]Meanwhile, Moctezuma\'s ambassadors, who had been in the Spanish camp after the battles with the Tlaxcalans, continued to press Cortés to take the road to Mexico via Cholula, which was under Aztec control, rather than over Huexotzinco, which was an ally of Tlaxcala. They were surprised Cortés had stayed in Tlaxcala so long ""among a poor and ill-bred people"".[47]: 166, 185–86Cholula was one of the most important cities of Mesoamerica, the second largest, and probably the most sacred.[citation needed] Its huge pyramid (larger in volume than the great pyramids of Egypt)[73] made it one of the most prestigious places of the Aztec religion. However, it appears that Cortés perceived Cholula more as a military threat to his rear guard than a religious center, as he marched to Tenochtitlan. He sent emissaries ahead to try a diplomatic solution to enter the city.Cortés, who had not yet decided to start a war with the Aztec Empire, decided to offer a compromise. He accepted the gifts of the Aztec ambassadors, and at the same time accepted the offer of the Tlaxcalan allies to provide porters and 1,000 warriors on his march to Cholula. He also sent two men, Pedro de Alvarado and Bernardino Vázquez de Tapia, directly to Tenochtitlan, as ambassadors and to scout for an appropriate route.[47]: 186–88Massacre of Cholula[edit]There are contradictory reports about what happened at Cholula. Moctezuma had apparently decided to resist with force the advance of Cortés and his troops, and it seems that Moctezuma ordered the leaders of Cholula to try to stop the Spanish. Cholula had a very small army, because as a sacred city they put their confidence in their prestige and their gods. According to the chronicles of the Tlaxcalteca, the priests of Cholula expected to use the power of Quetzalcoatl, their primary god, against the invaders.[47]: 193, 199Cortés and his men entered Cholula without active resistance. However, they were not met by the city leaders and were not given food and drink on the third day.[47]: 192 Cempoalans reported that fortifications were being constructed around the city and the Tlaxcalans were warning the Spaniards.[47]: 193 Finally, La Malinche informed Cortés, after talking to the wife of one of the lords of Cholula, that the locals planned to murder the Spanish in their sleep.[47]: 196 Although he did not know if the rumor was true or not, Cortés ordered a pre-emptive strike, urged by the Tlaxcalans, the enemies of the Cholulans. Cortés confronted the city leaders in the main temple alleging that they were planning to attack his men. They admitted that they had been ordered to resist by Moctezuma, but they claimed they had not followed his orders. Regardless, on command, the Spaniards seized and killed many of the local nobles to serve as a lesson.[47]: 199They captured the Cholulan leaders Tlaquiach and Tlalchiac and then ordered the city to be set on fire. The troops started in the palace of Xacayatzin, and then on to Chialinco and Yetzcoloc. In letters to his King, Cortés claimed that in three hours time his troops (helped by the Tlaxcalans) killed 3,000 people and had burned the city.[74] Another witness, Vázquez de Tapia, claimed the death toll was as high as 30,000. However, since the women and children, and many men, had already fled the city,[47]: 200–01 it is unlikely that so many were killed. Regardless, the massacre of the nobility of Cholula was a notorious chapter in the conquest of Mexico.The Azteca and Tlaxcalteca histories of the events leading up to the massacre vary; the Tlaxcalteca claimed that their ambassador Patlahuatzin was sent to Cholula and had been tortured by the Cholula. Thus, Cortés was avenging him by attacking Cholula.[42]: 46–47 (Historia de Tlaxcala, por Diego Muñoz Camargo, lib. II cap. V. 1550). The Azteca version put the blame on the Tlaxcalteca, claiming that they resented Cortés going to Cholula instead of Huexotzingo.[75]The massacre had a chilling effect on the other city states and groups affiliated with the Aztecs, as well as the Aztecs themselves. Tales of the massacre convinced the other cities in the Aztec Empire to entertain seriously Cortés\' proposals rather than risk the same fate.[47]: 203Cortés then sent emissaries to Moctezuma with the message that the people of Cholula had treated him with trickery and had therefore been punished.[47]: 204In one of his responses to Cortés, Moctezuma blamed the commanders of the local Aztec garrison for the resistance in Cholula, and recognizing that his long-standing attempts to dissuade Cortés from coming to Tenochtitlan with gifts of gold and silver had failed, Moctezuma finally invited the conquistadors to visit his capital city, according to Spanish sources, after feeling as though nothing else could be done.[54][47]: 205–06Entry into Tenochtitlan[edit]On 8 November 1519, after the fall of Cholula, Cortés and his forces entered Tenochtitlan, the island capital of the Mexica-Aztecs.[47]: 219 It is believed that the city was one of the largest in the world at that time, and the largest in the Americas up to that point.[76] The most common estimates put the population at around 60,000 to over 300,000 people.[77] If the population of Tenochtitlan was 250,000 in 1519, then Tenochtitlan would have been larger than every city in Europe except perhaps Naples and Constantinople, and four times the size of Seville.[76]To the Aztecs, Tenochtitlan was the ""altar"" for the Empire, as well as being the city that Quetzalcoatl would eventually return to.[78]Cortés welcomed by Moctezuma[edit]Upon meeting, Hernan Cortés claimed to be the representative of the queen, Doña Juana of Castile, and her son, King Carlos I of Castile and Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, all Spanish royalty, had then made an appearance.[79] Sahagún reports that Moctezuma welcomed Cortés to Tenochtitlan on the Great Causeway, Xolac.[47]: 216–17 ""The chiefs who accompanied Moctezuma were: Cacamatzin, king of Tetzcoco; Tetlepanquetzaltin, king of Tlacopan, Itzcuauhtzin the Tlacochcalcatl, lord of Tlatelolco; and Topantemoc, Motechzoma\'s treasurer in Tlatelolco.""[42]: 65 Moctezuma and his chiefs were adorned with blazing gold on their shoulders with feathers and jewels.[80] On the causeway where the two groups met, enormous numbers of people from Tenochtitlan watched the exchange.[81]Moctezuma went to greet Cortés with his brother, Cuitláhuac, and his nephew, Cacamatzin. Cortés strode ahead of his commanders and attempted to embrace Moctezuma, but was restrained by Cuitlahuac and Cacamatzin.[46] Cortés was not permitted to touch the emperor; no one was allowed.[79]After greetings, Moctezuma personally dressed only Cortés in a priceless feather-work flower, a golden jewelry studded necklace and a garland of flowers. Moctezuma then brought Cortés to the shrine of the goddess Toci, where he gave him a more private greeting, in which he practically gave the Aztec Empire to Cortés,[46] as he reportedly said that it was his ""desire to serve.""[79]A fragment of the greetings of Moctezuma says: ""My lord, you have become fatigued, you have become tired: to the land you have arrived. You have come to your city: Mexico, here you have come to sit on your place, on your throne. Oh, it has been reserved to you for a small time, it was conserved by those who have gone, your substitutes ... This is what has been told by our rulers, those of whom governed this city, ruled this city. That you would come to ask for your throne, your place, that you would come here. Come to the land, come and rest: take possession of your royal houses, give food to your body.""[42]: 64 [82]Moctezuma had the royal palace of Axayácatl, Moctezuma\'s father, prepared for Cortés.[47]: 218 On the same day that the Spanish expedition and their allies entered Tenochtitlan, Moctezuma came to visit Cortés and his men. What happened in this second meeting remains controversial. According to several Spanish versions, some written years or decades later, Moctezuma first repeated his earlier, flowery welcome to Cortés on the Great Causeway, but then went on to explain his view of what the Spanish expedition represented in terms of Aztec tradition and lore, including the idea that Cortés and his men (pale, bearded men from the east) were the return of characters from Aztec legend.[47]: 220–21 At the end of this explanation, the Emperor pledged his loyalty to the King of Spain and accepted Cortés as the King\'s representative. According to Diaz, Moctezuma said to Cortés, ""As for your great King, I am in his debt and will give him of what I possess.""[47]: 223While in the Axayacatl palace, the conquistadors discovered the secret room where Moctezuma kept the treasure he had inherited from his father. The treasure consisted of a ""quantity of golden objects – jewels and plates and ingots"". Diaz noted, ""The sight of all that wealth dumbfounded me.""[47]: 218, 242Cortés later asked Moctezuma to allow him to erect a cross and an image of Virgin Mary next to the two large idols of Huichilobos and Tezcatlipoca, after climbing the one hundred and fourteen steps to the top of the main temple pyramid, a central place for religious authority.[83] Moctezuma and his papas were furious at the suggestion, with Moctezuma claiming his idols, ""give us health and rain and crops and weather, and all the victories we desire.""[47]: 237After Cortés\' request surrounding the questioning of raising the cross and the image of the Virgin Mary, the Mexica then killed seven Spanish soldiers Cortés had left on the coast, including Cortés\' Villa Rica Constable Juan de Escalante, and many Totonacs. Cortés along with five of his captains and Doña Marina and Aguilar, convinced Moctezuma to ""come quietly with us to our quarters, and make no protest ... if you cry out, or raise any commotion, you will immediately be killed."" Moctezuma was later implicated by Qualpopoca and his captains, who had killed the Spanish soldiers. Though these captains of Moctezuma were sentenced to be ""burned to death"", Moctezuma continued to remain a prisoner, fearing a ""rebellion in his city"" or that the Spanish may ""try to set up another prince in his place."" This, despite Moctezuma\'s chieftains, nephews and relations suggesting they should attack the Spanish.[47]: 243–49As of 14 November 1519, Moctezuma was Cortés\' prisoner as insurance against any further resistance, until the end of May 1520, Moctezuma lived with Cortés in the palace of Axayácatl.However, Moctezuma continued to act as Emperor, subject to Cortés\' overall control.[47]: 248 During the period of his imprisonment, Moctezuma stated ""he was glad to be a prisoner, since either our gods gave us power to confine him or Huichilobos permitted it."" He would even play the game of totoloque with Cortés.[47]: 252 After the treason of Cacamatzin, Moctezuma and his caciques, were forced to take a more formal oath of allegiance to the King of Spain, though Moctezuma ""could not restrain his tears"".[47]: 265 Moctezuma told his caciques that ""their ancestral tradition, set down in their books of records,[clarification needed] that men would come from the direction of the sunrise to rule these lands"" and that ""He believed ... we were these men.""[47]: 264Cortés sent expeditions to investigate the Aztec sources of gold in the provinces of Zacatula, Tuxtepec, and the land of the Chinantec.[47]: 265–69 Moctezuma was then made to pay a tribute to the Spanish King, which included his father\'s treasure. These treasures, the Spaniards melted down to form gold bars stamped with an iron die.[42]: 66–68 [47]: 270–72 Finally, Moctezuma let the Catholic conquistadors build an altar on their temple, next to the Aztec idols.[47]: 277Finally, the Aztec gods allegedly told the Mexican papas, or priests, they would not stay unless the Spaniards were killed and driven back across the sea.[clarification needed] Moctezuma warned Cortés to leave at once, as their lives were at risk.[47]: 278–79 Many of the nobility rallied around Cuitláhuac,[47]: 294 the brother of Moctezuma and his heir-apparent; however, most of them could take no overt action against the Spanish unless the order was given by the Emperor.[47]: 247Defeat of Narváez[edit]In April 1520, Cortés was told by Moctezuma that a much larger party of Spanish troops had arrived, consisting of nineteen ships and fourteen hundred soldiers under the command of Pánfilo de Narváez. Narváez had been sent by Governor Velázquez from Cuba to kill or capture Cortés, who had defied Velazquez\'s orders.[47]: 281Leaving his ""least reliable soldiers"" under the command of the headstrong Pedro de Alvarado to guard Moctezuma, Cortés set out against Narváez, who had advanced onto Cempoala. Cortés surprised his antagonist with a night attack, during which his men wounded Narváez in the eye and took him prisoner. After Cortés permitted the defeated soldiers to settle in the country, they ""passed with more or less willingness to Cortés\' side."" Hernán Cortés gained their support when he ""promised to make them rich and give them commands [rewards]."" Cortés then made a rapid return to Tenochtitlan to relieve the besieged Alvarado and the other invaders.[47]: 282–84 [clarification needed]Cortés led his combined forces on an arduous trek back over the Sierra Madre Oriental, returning to Mexico on St. John\'s Day June 1520, with 1,300 soldiers and 96 horses, plus 2,000 Tlaxcalan warriors.[47]: 284The Aztec response[edit]When Cortés returned to Tenochtitlan in late May, he found that Alvarado and his men had attacked and killed many of the Aztec nobility in the Massacre in the Great Temple, that happened during a religious festival organized by the Aztecs. The Great Temple was central to the Aztecs\' cosmological views; the temple served as a burial ground for the offerings made to different gods, such as the gods of fertility, mountains, rain, and earth.[84] Considering the centrality and the importance of the Great Temple as a religious and cultural monument could potentially have influenced the decision to attack a location such as this. Alvarado\'s explanation to Cortés was that the Spaniards had learned that the Aztecs planned to attack the Spanish garrison in the city once the festival was complete, so he had launched a preemptive attack.[47]: 286The Spanish retreat from Tenochtitlan[edit]In any event, the population of the city rose en masse after the Spanish attack, which the Spanish did not expect.[85][clarification needed] Fierce fighting ensued, and the Aztec troops besieged the palace housing the Spaniards and Moctezuma. Alvarado and the rest of the Spanish were held hostage by the Aztecs for a month.[85] The nobility of Tenochtitlan chose Cuitláhuac as Huey Tlatoani (Emperor). Cortés ordered Moctezuma to speak to his people from a palace balcony and persuade them to let the Spanish return to the coast in peace. Moctezuma was jeered and stones were thrown at him, mortally wounding him.[47]: 287–94 Aztec sources state the Spaniards killed him.[42]: 90Cortés had formed an alliance with Tlaxcala. This alliance had many victories, including the overtaking of the Aztec Capital Tenochtitlan. Their capital was used as a cosmic center, where they fed sacrifices to the gods through both human bodies and bloodletting. The capital was also used for central and imperialistic governmental control. Preparations for war began in their capital.[86] The Spanish and their allies, including the Tlaxcala, had to flee the central city, as the people of Tenochtitlan had risen against them. The Spaniards\' situation could only deteriorate. Because the Aztecs had removed the bridges over the gaps in the causeways that linked the city to the surrounding lands, Cortés\' men constructed a portable bridge to cross the water of the lake. On the rainy night of 10 July 1520, the Spaniards and their allies set out for the mainland via the causeway to Tlacopan. They placed the portable bridge in the first gap, but at that moment their movement was detected and Aztec forces attacked, both along the causeway and by means of canoes on the lake. The Spanish were thus caught on a narrow road with water or buildings on both sides.[47]: 297–99, 305The retreat quickly turned into a rout. The Spanish discovered that they could not remove their portable bridge unit from the first gap, and so had no choice but to leave it behind. The bulk of the Spanish infantry, left behind by Cortés and the other horsemen, had to cut their way through the masses of Aztec warriors opposing them. Many of the Spaniards, weighed down by their armor and booty, drowned in the causeway gaps or were killed by the Aztecs. Much of the wealth the Spaniards had acquired in Tenochtitlan was lost. The bridge was later called ""Alvarado\'s Leap"".[47]: 299–300, 306The channel is now a street in Mexico City, called ""Puente de Alvarado"" (Alvarado\'s Bridge), because it seemed Alvarado escaped across an invisible bridge (He may have been walking on the bodies of those soldiers and attackers who had preceded him, given the shallowness of the lake.).[citation needed]It is said that Cortés, upon reaching the mainland at Tlacopan, wept over their losses. This episode is called ""La Noche Triste"" (The Night of Sorrows), and the old tree (""El árbol de la noche triste"") where Cortés allegedly cried, is still a monument in Mexico City.The Aztecs pursued and harassed the Spanish, who, guided by their Tlaxcalan allies, moved around Lake Zumpango towards a sanctuary in Tlaxcala. On 14 July 1520, the Aztecs attempted to destroy the Spanish for good at the Battle of Otumba. Although hard-pressed, the Spanish infantry was able to hold off the overwhelming numbers of enemy warriors, while the Spanish cavalry under the leadership of Cortés charged through the enemy ranks again and again. When Cortés and his men killed one of the Aztec leaders, the Aztecs broke off the battle and left the field.[47]: 303–05In this retreat, the Spaniards suffered heavy casualties, losing 860 soldiers, 72 other Spanish members of Cortés\' group, including five women, and 1,000 Tlaxcalan warriors. Several Aztec noblemen loyal to Cortés, including Cacamatzin, and their families also perished, including Moctezuma\'s son and two daughters.[47]: 302, 305–06Spaniards find refuge in Tlaxcala[edit]The Spanish were able to complete their escape to Tlaxcala. There, they were given assistance, since all 440 of them were wounded, with only 20 horses left. Maxixcatzin, Xicotencatl the Elder and Chichimecatecle told Cortés\' men: ""Consider yourselves at home. Rest ... do not think it a small thing that you have escaped with your lives from that strong city ... if we thought of you as brave men before, we consider you much braver now.""[47]: 306–07Cortés got reinforcements when the Panuco River settlement was abandoned, and supply ships arrived from Cuba and Spain. Cortés also had built 13 brigantines and had them mounted with cannons, turning Lake Texcoco into a strategic body of water to assault Tenochtitlan. Xicotencatl the Younger, however, sought an alliance with the Mexicans, but was opposed.[47]: 309–11Cortés sent Diego de Ordaz and the remnants of Narvaez\'s men, on a ship to Spain, and Francisco Montejo on a ship to Santo Domingo to represent his case in the Royal Courts.[47]: 311Cortés was able to pacify the country, after the indigenous realized the Spaniards put ""an end to the rape and robbery that the Mexicans practised."". Finally, Xicotencatl the Elder, baptized as Don Lorenzo de Vargas, agreed to support Cortés\' expedition against Texcoco. According to Bernal Diaz, he sent more than 10,000 warriors under the command of Chichimecatecle as Cortés marched on the day after Christmas 1520.[47]: 309, 311–12Siege and fall of Tenochtitlan[edit]The Aztecs were struck by a smallpox plague starting in September 1520, which lasted seventy days. Many were killed, including their new leader, the Emperor Cuitlahuac.[42]: 92–93The joint forces of Tlaxcala and Cortés proved to be formidable. One by one they took over most of the cities under Aztec control, some in battle, others by diplomacy. In the end, only Tenochtitlan and the neighboring city of Tlatelolco remained unconquered or not allied with the Spaniards.[47]: 326–52Cortés then approached Tenochtitlan and mounted a siege of the city that involved cutting the causeways from the mainland and controlling the lake with armed brigantines constructed by the Spanish and transported overland to the lake. The Siege of Tenochtitlan lasted eight months. The besiegers cut off the supply of food and destroyed the aqueduct carrying water to the city.[47]: 359, 368Despite the stubborn Aztec resistance organized by their new emperor, Cuauhtémoc, the cousin of Moctezuma II, Tenochtitlan and Tlatelolco fell on 13 August 1521, during which the Emperor was captured trying to escape the city in a canoe. The siege of the city and its defense had both been brutal. Largely because he wanted to present the city to his king and emperor, Cortés had made several attempts to end the siege through diplomacy, but all offers were rejected. During the battle, the defenders cut the beating hearts from seventy Spanish prisoners-of-war at the altar to Huitzilopochtli, an act that infuriated the Spaniards.[47]: 386–87, 391, 401–03Cortés then ordered the idols of the Aztec gods in the temples to be taken down and replaced with icons of Christianity. He also announced that the temple would never again be used for human sacrifice. Human sacrifice and reports of cannibalism, common among the natives of the Aztec Empire, had been a major reason motivating Cortés and encouraging his soldiers to avoid surrender while fighting to the death.[47]Tenochtitlan had been almost totally destroyed using the manpower of the Tlaxcalans plus fire and cannon fire during the siege, and once it finally fell, the Spanish continued its destruction, as they soon began to establish the foundations of what would become Mexico City on the site. The surviving Aztec people were forbidden to live in Tenochtitlan and the surrounding isles, and were banished to live in Tlatelolco.Conquistador Bernal Díaz del Castillo seemed remorseful after the sacking of Tenochtitlan. He said later in his book, The True History of the Conquest of New Spain that the natives had showered them with gifts, and given them rooms and food. He was dazzled by the gardens and the canals that flowed around the city. ""When I beheld the scenes around me"", said Díaz,[87] ""I thought within myself, this was the garden of the world. All of the wonders I beheld that day, nothing now remains. All is overthrown and lost.""[88]Further Spanish Wars of Conquest[edit]Michoacan[edit]After hearing about the fall of the Aztec Empire, Irecha Tangaxuan II sent emissaries to the Spanish victors (the Purépecha empire was a contemporary and enemy of the Aztec Empire). A few Spaniards went with them to Tzintzuntzan, where they were presented to the ruler and gifts were exchanged. They returned with samples of gold and Cortés\' interest in the Tarascan state was awakened.In 1522 a Spanish force under the leadership of Cristobal de Olid was sent into Purépecha territory and arrived at Tzintzuntzan within days. The imperial army numbered many thousands, perhaps as many as 100,000, but at the crucial moment they chose not to fight.[89] Tangaxuan submitted to the Spanish administration, but for his cooperation was allowed a large degree of autonomy. This resulted in a strange arrangement where both Cortés and Tangáxuan considered themselves rulers of Michoacán for the following years: the population of the area paid tribute to them both.Later, Nuño Beltrán de Guzmán, then president of the first Audiencia, decided to march on northwestern Mexico with a force of 5,000–8,000 men in search for new populations to subdue. He arrived in Michoacán and found out that Tangaxuan was still the de facto ruler of his empire, for which the conquistador allied himself with Don Pedro Panza Cuinierángari against the Irecha. Tangaxuan was tried with plotting a rebellion, withholding tribute, sodomy and heresy, and he was tortured and executed.[90] His ashes were thrown into the Lerma River. A period of violence and turbulence began. During the next decades, puppet rulers were installed by the Spanish government.Conquest of the Yucatán Peninsula[edit]The Spanish conquest of Yucatán took almost 170 years. The whole process could have taken longer were it not for three separate epidemics that took a heavy toll on the Native Americans, causing the population to fall by half and weakening the traditional social structure.[91]Chichimec Wars[edit]After the Spanish conquest of central Mexico, expeditions were sent further northward in Mesoamerica, to the region known as La Gran Chichimeca. The expeditions under Nuño Beltrán de Guzmán were particularly harsh on the Chichimeca population, causing them to rebel under the leadership of Tenamaxtli and thus launch the Mixton War.In 1540, the Chichimecas fortified Mixtón, Nochistlán, and other mountain towns then besieged the Spanish settlement in Guadalajara. The famous conquistador Pedro de Alvarado, coming to the aid of acting governor Cristóbal de Oñate, led an attack on Nochistlán. However, the Chichimecas counter-attacked and Alvarado\'s forces were routed. Under the leadership of Viceroy Don Antonio de Mendoza, the Spanish forces and their Indigenous allies ultimately succeeded in recapturing the towns and suppressing resistance. However, fighting did not completely come to a halt in the ensuing years.In 1546, Spanish authorities discovered silver in the Zacatecas region and established mining settlements in Chichimeca territory which altered the terrain and the Chichimeca traditional way of life. The Chichimeca resisted the intrusions on their ancestral lands by attacking travelers and merchants along the ""silver roads."" The ensuing Chichimeca War (1550–1590) would become the longest and costliest conflict between Spanish forces and indigenous peoples in the Americas. The attacks intensified with each passing year. In 1554, the Chichimecas inflicted a great loss upon the Spanish when they attacked a train of sixty wagons and captured more than 30,000 pesos worth of valuables. By the 1580s, thousands had died and Spanish mining settlements in Chichimeca territory were continually under threat. In 1585, Don Alvaro Manrique de Zúñiga, Marquis of Villamanrique, was appointed viceroy. The viceroy was infuriated when he learned that some Spanish soldiers had begun supplementing their incomes by raiding the villages of peaceful Indians in order to sell them into slavery. With no military end to the conflict in sight, he was determined to restore peace to that region and launched a full-scale peace offensive by negotiating with Chichimeca leaders and providing them with lands, agricultural supplies, and other goods. This policy of ""peace by purchase"" finally brought an end to the Chichimeca War.[92] lThe Aztecs under Spanish rule[edit]The Council of the Indies was constituted in 1524 and the first Audiencia in 1527. In 1535, Charles V the Holy Roman Emperor (who was as the King of Spain known as Charles I), named the Spanish nobleman Don Antonio de Mendoza the first Viceroy of New Spain. Mendoza was entirely loyal to the Spanish crown, unlike the conqueror of Mexico Hernán Cortés, who had demonstrated that he was independent-minded and defied official orders when he threw off the authority of Governor Velázquez in Cuba. The name ""New Spain"" had been suggested by Cortés and was later confirmed officially by Mendoza.The Aztec Empire ceased to exist with the Spanish final conquest of Tenochtitlan in August 1521. The empire had been composed of separate city-states that had either allied with or been conquered by the Mexica of Tenochtitlan, and rendered tribute to the Mexica while maintaining their internal ruling structures. Those polities now came under Spanish rule, also retaining their internal structures of ruling elites and tribute-paying commoners, as well as land holding and other economic structures being largely intact. Two key works by historian Charles Gibson, Tlaxcala in the Sixteenth Century (1952)[93] and his monograph The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule: A History of the Indians of the Valley of Mexico, 1519–1810 (1964)[94] were central in reshaping the historiography of the indigenous and their communities from the Spanish conquest to the 1810 Mexican independence era.[95]Scholars who were part of a branch of Mesoamerican ethnohistory, more recently called the New Philology have, using indigenous texts in the indigenous languages, been able to examine in considerable detail how the indigenous lived during the era of Spanish colonial rule. A major work that utilizes colonial-era indigenous texts as its main source is James Lockhart\'s The Nahuas After the Conquest: Postconquest Central Mexican History and Philology.[96] The key to understanding how considerable continuity of pre-Conquest indigenous structures was possible was the Spanish colonial utilization of the indigenous nobility. In the colonial era, the indigenous nobility were largely recognized as nobles by the Spanish colonial regime, with privileges including the noble Spanish title don for noblemen and doña for noblewomen. To this day, the title of Duke of Moctezuma is held by a Spanish noble family. A few of the indigenous nobility learned Spanish. Spanish friars taught indigenous tribes to write their own languages in Latin letters, which soon became a self-perpetuating tradition at the local level.[97] Their surviving writings are crucial in our knowledge of colonial era Nahuas.The first mendicants in central Mexico, particularly the Franciscans and Dominicans learned the indigenous language of Nahuatl, in order to evangelize to the indigenous people in their native tongue. Early mendicants created texts in order to forward the project of Christianization. Particularly important were the 1571 Spanish-Nahuatl dictionary compiled by the Franciscan Fray Alonso de Molina,[98] and his 1569 bilingual Nahuatl-Spanish confessional manual for priests.[99] A major project by the Franciscans in Mexico was the compilation of knowledge on Nahua religious beliefs and culture that friar Bernardino de Sahagún oversaw using indigenous informants, resulting in a number of important texts and culminating in a 12 volume text, The General History of the Things of New Spain published in English as the Florentine Codex. The Spanish crown via the Council of the Indies and the Franciscan order in the late sixteenth century became increasingly hostile to works in the indigenous languages written by priests and clerics, concerned that they were heretical and an impediment to the Indians\' true conversion.[100]To reward Spaniards who participated in the conquest of what is now contemporary Mexico,[citation needed] the Spanish crown authorized grants of native labor, in particular the assignment of entire indigenous communities to labor via the Encomienda system. The indigenous were not slaves under this system,[citation needed] chattel bought and sold or removed from their home community, but the system was still one of forced labor. The indigenous people of Central Mexico had practices rendering labor and tribute products to their polity\'s elites and those elites to the Mexica overlords in Tenochtitlan, so the Spanish system of encomienda was built on pre-existing patterns of labor service.[citation needed]The Spanish conquerors in Mexico during the early colonial era lived off the labor of the indigenous peoples. Due to some horrifying instances of abuse against the native peoples, Bishop Bartolomé de las Casas suggested importing black slaves to replace them. Las Casas later repented when he saw the even worse treatment given to the black slaves.[101]The other discovery that perpetuated this system of indigenous forced labor were the extensive silver mines discovered at Potosi, in Higher Peru (now Bolivia) and other places in the Spanish empire in the New World that were worked for hundreds of years by forced native labor and contributed most of the wealth that flowed to Spain.According to West, ""slavery was a well-established institution among the Aztecs and their neighbors."" ""During the Conquest, Spaniards legally enslaved large numbers of natives – men, women and children – as booty of warfare, branding each individual on the cheek."" In fact, ""Cortés owned several hundred, used mainly in gold placering."" Indian slavery was abolished in 1542 but persisted until the 1550s.[102]Spain spent enormous amounts of this wealth hiring mercenaries to fight the Protestant Reformation and to halt the Turkish invasions of Europe. The silver was used to purchase commercial goods abroad, as European manufactured goods were not in demand in Asia and the Middle East. The Manila Galleon brought in far more silver direct from South American mines to China than the overland Silk Road, or even European trade routes in the Indian Ocean could.The Aztec education system was abolished and replaced by a very limited church education. Even some foods associated with Mesoamerican religious practice, such as amaranth, were forbidden.[citation needed] Catholic missionaries campaigned against cultural traditions of the Aztecs, and the use of psilocybin mushrooms, like other pre-Christian traditions, was quickly suppressed. In converting people to Catholicism, the Spanish pushed for a switch from teonanácatl to the Catholic sacrament of the Eucharist. Despite this history, in some remote areas, the use of teonanácatl has persisted.[103]In the 16th century, perhaps 240,000 Spaniards entered American ports. They were joined by 450,000 in the next century.[104] Unlike the English-speaking colonists of North America, the majority of the Spanish colonists were single men who married or made concubines of the natives,[citation needed] and were even encouraged to do so by Queen Isabella I during the earliest days of colonization. As a result of these unions, as well as concubinage[citation needed] and secret mistresses, mixed race individuals known as mestizos became the majority of the Mexican population in the centuries following the Spanish conquest.Cultural depictions of the Aztecs[edit]The Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire is the subject of an opera, La Conquista (2005) and of a set of six symphonic poems, La Nueva España (1992–99) by Italian composer Lorenzo Ferrero.Cortés\'s conquest has been depicted in numerous television documentaries. These include in an episode of Engineering an Empire as well as in the BBC series Heroes and Villains, with Cortés being portrayed by Brian McCardie.Captain from Castile (1947) is about early Cortés and the Aztec.The expedition was also partially included in the animated film The Road to El Dorado as the main characters Tulio and Miguel end up as stowaways on Hernán Cortés\' fleet to Mexico. Here, Cortés is represented as a merciless and ambitious villain, leading a quest to find El Dorado, the legendary city of gold in the New World. Hernán Cortés is voiced by Jim Cummings.The aftermath of the Spanish conquest, including the Aztecs\' struggle to preserve their cultural identity, is the subject of the Mexican feature film, The Other Conquest, directed by Salvador Carrasco.Historian Daniele Bolelli did an in-depth coverage of the Spanish conquest over four episodes of his History on Fire podcast.[105]Mexican muralist Diego Rivera (1886–1957) painted History of Morelos, Conquest and Revolution on the walls of the Cortés Palace in Cuernavaca in 1929–1930.An historical drama series in Mayan, Nahuatl, and Spanish entitled Hernán was co-produced by Televisión Azteca, Dopamine, and Onza Entertainment in 2019. The plot revolves around Hernán Cortés and his cadre from his arrival at the Mexican coast until the defeat of the Mexicas.A fictionalized version of the fall of Tenochtitlan was depicted in the 2021 Marvel Cinematic Universe film Eternals.See also[edit]Notes[edit]- ^ Teoría de la bandera.Guido Villa.1974 ""The companies portentous discovery and conquest of the New World, met under the banners of Castile incarnate"".

There are multiple 16th-century narratives of the events by Spanish conquistadors, their indigenous allies, and the defeated Aztecs. It was not solely a small contingent of Spaniards defeating the Aztec Empire but a coalition of Spanish invaders with tributaries to the Aztecs, and most especially the Aztecs\' indigenous enemies and rivals. They combined forces to defeat the Mexica of Tenochtitlan over a two-year period. For the Spanish, Mexico was part of a project of Spanish colonization of the New World after 25 years of permanent Spanish settlement and further exploration in the Caribbean.\n\nFollowing an earlier expedition to Yucatán led by Juan de Grijalva in 1518, Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés led an expedition (entrada) to Mexico. The next year, Cortés and his retinue set sail for Mexico. The Spanish campaign against the Aztec Empire had its final victory on 13 August 1521, when a coalition army of Spanish forces and native Tlaxcalan warriors led by Cortés and Xicotencatl the Younger captured the emperor Cuauhtémoc and Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec Empire. The fall of Tenochtitlan marks the beginning of Spanish rule in central Mexico, and they established their capital of Mexico City on the ruins of Tenochtitlan.\n\nCortés made alliances with tributary city-states (altepetl) of the Aztec Empire as well as their political rivals, particularly the Tlaxcaltecs and Tetzcocans, a former partner in the Aztec Triple Alliance. Other city-states also joined, including Cempoala and Huejotzingo and polities bordering Lake Texcoco, the inland lake system of the Valley of Mexico. Particularly important to the Spanish success was a multilingual (Nahuatl, a Maya dialect, and Spanish) Nahua-speaking woman enslaved by the Mayas, known to the Spanish conquistadors as Doña Marina, and later as La Malinche. After eight months of battles and negotiations, which overcame the diplomatic resistance of the Aztec Emperor Moctezuma II to his visit, Cortés arrived in Tenochtitlan on 8 November 1519, where he took up residence with fellow Spaniards and their indigenous allies. When news reached Cortés of the death of several of his men during the Aztec attack on the Totonacs in Veracruz, Cortés claims that he took Motecuhzoma captive. Capturing the cacique or indigenous ruler was a standard operating procedure for Spaniards in their expansion in the Caribbean, so capturing Motecuhzoma had considerable precedent but modern scholars are skeptical that Cortés and his countrymen took Motecuhzoma captive at this time. They had great incentive to claim they did, owing to the laws of Spain at this time, but critical analysis of their personal writings suggest Motecuhzoma was not taken captive until a much later date.\n\nWhen Cortés left Tenochtitlan to return to the coast and deal with the threat of the expedition of Pánfilo de Narváez, Cortés left Pedro de Alvarado in charge of Tenochtitlan. Cortés left with a small army to the coast with the plan of attacking during the night. After defeating Narváez\'s fleet, Cortés convinced most of his enemy\'s crew to go with him by promising great riches. Upon reaching Tenochtitlan, Cortés and the new enlarged force received the message that ""the Aztec had risen against the Spanish garrison"" during a religious celebration. Alvarado ordered his army to attack the unarmed crowd; he later claims that the Aztecs had used the celebration to cover up a counterattack. Cortés realized that the defeat was imminent and decided to escape yet, the Aztecs attacked. The Massacre is most known as the Noche Triste (the sorrowful night) about ""400 Spaniards, 4000 native allies and many horses [were killed] before reaching the mainland"". Moctezuma was killed, although the sources do not agree on who killed him. According to one account, when Moctezuma, now seen by the population as a mere puppet of the invading Spaniards, attempted to calm the outraged populace, he was killed by a projectile. According to an indigenous account, the Spanish killed Moctezuma. Cortés had returned to Tenochtitlan and his men fled the capital city during the Noche Triste in June 1520. The Spanish, Tlaxcalans and reinforcements returned a year later on 13 August 1521 to a civilization that had been weakened by famine and smallpox. This made it easier to conquer the remaining Aztecs. The Spaniards\' victory is attributed to their help from indigenous allies, technology, and the Aztec empire\'s vulnerability due to the smallpox spread. As a result, the Aztec\'s tactics countering the Spaniard\'s advanced technology is understated. According to Hassig, ""It is true that cannons, guns, crossbows, steel blades, horses and war dogs were advanced on the Aztecs\' weaponry. But the advantage these gave a few hundred Spanish soldiers was not overwhelming."" In the words of Restall, ""Spanish weapons were useful for breaking the offensive lines of waves of indigenous warriors, but this was no formula for conquest ... rather, it was a formula for survival, until Spanish and indigenous reinforcements arrived.""\n\nThe integration of the indigenous allies, essentially, those from Tlaxcala and Texcoco, into the Spanish army played a crucial role in the conquest, yet other factors paved the path for the Spaniards\' success. For instance, the Spaniards\' timing of entry, the compelling ideologies of both groups, and the Spanish unfamiliarity with the Aztec Empire. Therefore, the Spaniards lacked a sense of danger and power structure within the empire. ""A direct attack on a city as mighty as Tenochtitlan was unlikely and unexpected"" from the enemy empires. As well, it was very uncommon that an attacking army would come unannounced. In addition, aside from the infantry and the allies\' role in the Spanish conquest, cavalry was the ""arm of decision in the conquest"" and ""the key ingredient in the Spanish forces"".\n\nMany of those on the Cortés expedition of 1519 had never seen combat before, including Cortés. A whole generation of Spaniards later participated in expeditions in the Caribbean and Tierra Firme (Central America), learning strategy and tactics of successful enterprises. The Spanish conquest of Mexico had antecedents with established practices.\n\nThe fall of the Aztec Empire was the key event in the formation of the Spanish Empire overseas, with New Spain, which later became'}
 {'raw_text': 'The Aztec Empire, Mesoamerica’s dominant power in the 15th and early 16th centuries controlled a capital city that was one of the largest in the world. Itzcoatl, named leader of the Aztec/Mexica people in 1427, negotiated what has become known as the Triple Alliance—a powerful political union of the city-states of Mexico-Tenochtitlán, Tetzcoco and Tlacopán. As that alliance strengthened between 1428 and 1430 it reinforced the leadership of the Aztecs, making them the dominant Nahua group in a landmass that covered central Mexico and extended as far as modern-day Guatemala.And yet Tenochtitlán was conquered by the Spanish in 1521—less than two years after Hernándo Cortés and Spanish conquistadors first set foot in the Aztec capital on November 8, 1519. How did Cortés manage to overthrow the seat of the Aztec Empire?Tenochtitlán: A Dominant Imperial CityWhen Spanish conquistadors arrived in the Aztec imperial city in 1519, Mexico-Tenochtitlán was led by Moctezuma II. The city had prospered and was estimated to host a population of between 200,000 and 300,000 residents.At first, the conquistadors described Tenochtitlán as the greatest city they had ever seen. It was situated on a human-made island in the middle of Lake Texcoco. From its central location, Tenochtitlán served as a hub for Aztec trade and politics. It featured gardens, palaces, temples and raised roads with bridges that connected the city to the mainland.Other city-states were forced to pay periodic tributes to Tenochtitlán’s public markets and to its religious center, the Templo Mayor or “Great Temple.” Religious tributes sometimes took the form of human sacrifices. While the Aztec’s monetary and religious demands empowered the empire, it also fostered resentment among surrounding city-states.Hernándo Cortés Makes Allies with Local TribesHernándo Cortés formed part of Spain’s initial colonization efforts in the Americas. While stationed in Cuba, he convinced Cuban Governor Diego Velázquez to allow him to lead an expedition to Mexico, but Velázquez then canceled his mission. Eager to appropriate new land for the Spanish crown, convert Indigenous people to Christianity and plunder the region for gold and riches, Cortés organized his own rogue crew of 100 sailors, 11 ships, 508 soldiers and 16 horses. He set sail from Cuba on the morning of February 18, 1519, to begin an unauthorized expedition to Mesoamerica.Arriving on the Yucatán coast, Cortés encountered Indigenous people who told him about other Europeans who had been shipwrecked and captured by local Mayans. Cortes freed Jerónimo de Aguilar, a Franciscan friar, from the Mayans and made Aguilar part of his crew. Aguilar turned out to be an invaluable asset to Cortes due to his ability to speak Chontal, the local Mayan language. With Aguilar at his side, Cortés and his conquistadors continued traveling the region, battling Indigenous groups along the way.Cortés and his men then acquired another asset when an Aztec chief gifted them some 20 enslaved young Mayan women, including Malinalli, a Nahua woman from the Mexican Gulf Coast. Malinalli became baptized with the Christian name Marina and was later known as La Malinche. La Malinche spoke both the Aztec language of Náhuatl and Mayan Chontal and worked alongside the Spanish invaders, providing the conquistadors with the ability to communicate with any Indigenous groups they encountered.With La Malinche and Aguilar in tow, the conquistadors made their way to the island city of Tenochtitlán where they were initially welcomed by Emperor Moctezuma II. When Cortés became concerned that Moctezuma\'s people would turn against his men, he placed Moctezuma under house arrest and Cortés attempted to rule through the detained Moctezuma.Soon Cortés received word that the Cuban governor had sent a Spanish force to arrest Cortés for insubordination. Leaving his top lieutenant Pedro de Alvarado in charge of Tenochtitlán, Cortés took men to attack the Spanish forces at the coast. Cortes\'s men defeated the troops and took the surviving Spanish soldiers back with him as reinforcements to Tenochtitlán. In Cortés\' absence, Alvarado had hundreds of Aztec nobles killed during a ceremonial feast, leading to further unrest among the Aztec people.Tenochtitlán residents demanded the Spanish be removed from the city. When the detained Moctezuma could no longer control Tenochtitlán’s residents, the Spaniards either allowed him to die during a skirmish in 1520 or killed him—depending on varying accounts.Driven from the capital, the Spanish later circled back with a small fleet of ships. Working in alliance with some 200,000 Indigenous warriors from city-states, particularly the Tlaxcala and Cempoala (groups who had resented the Aztec/Mexicas and wanted to see them vanquished), the Spanish conquistadors held Tenochtitlán under siege from May 22 through August 13, 1521—a total of 93 days.Disease Further Weakens the AztecWith Tenochtitlán encircled, the conquistadors relied on their Indigenous allies for key logistical support and launched attacks from local Indigenous encampments. Meanwhile, another factor began to take its toll. Unbeknownst to the Spanish, some among their ranks had been infected with smallpox when they had departed Europe. Once these men arrived in the Americas, the virus began to spread—both among their indigenous allies and the Aztecs. (Some research has suggested that salmonella, not smallpox, had weakened the Aztecs.)The first known case reportedly emerged in Cempoala—one of the city-states that had allied with the Spanish—when an enslaved African came down with the disease. The virus then spread. As the Spaniards and their allies later attacked Tenochtitlán, even when they lost battles, the smallpox virus infected the Aztecs. Aztec troops, members of the noble class, farmers and artisans all fell victim to the disease.While many Spaniards had acquired immunity to the disease, the virus was new in the Americas and few Indigenous understood it. The bodies of smallpox victims piled up in the streets of Tenochtitlán and, with the city under siege, there were few available ways to dispose of the bodies.Spaniards and their allies were taken in as prisoners (the Aztecs tended to hold captured prisoners for sacrifice to the gods, rather than kill them in battle) and traces of the virus were left on the clothes, hair and on dead bodies of those who had had the disease. As Tenochtitlán residents contracted smallpox they had no place to turn for help. Aztec priests and medicinal practitioners knew of no remedy and Tenochtitlán residents had little immunity.The Spanish Wielded Better WeaponryThe conquistadors arrived in Mesoamerica with steel swords, muskets, cannons, pikes, crossbows, dogs and horses. None of these assets had yet been used in battle in the Americas. The Aztecs fought the Spanish with wooden broadswords, clubs and spears tipped with obsidian blades. But their weapons proved ineffective against the conquistadors’ metal armor and shields.When the Spanish arrived in the Americas they came from a war-oriented culture that had seen battle against other European nations for dominance and against North Africans for sovereignty. The conquistadors arrived in Mesoamerica with better guns and had been trained in tactical strategies. They deployed a cavalry that could chase down retreating warriors, dogs trained to track down and encircle enemies and horses capable of trampling adversaries.Up against large armies of Spanish and Indigenous forces, surrounded and cut off from the mainland, and with a population succumbing to an unknown, devastating virus, the Aztec Empire was unable to fight off the invading Spanish conquistadors. The Aztecs, including members of the Aztec royal family—then were forced to adjust to life under Spanish rule.Sources""Cada Uno En Su Bolsa Llevar Lo Que Cien Indios No Llevarían: Mexica Resistance and the Shape of Currency in New Spain, 1542-1552.” by Allison Caplan, American Journal of Numismatics (1989-), vol. 25, 2013, pp. 333–356.

 {'raw_text': 'What the Textbooks Have To Say About the Conquest of Mexico: Some Suggestions for Questions to Ask of the EvidenceTo begin to develop a sense of how complicated the history of the conquest of Mexico is, look at some of what some popular textbooks have to say. Make a list of what these authors agree upon. Note where they disagree with each other. How do the primary sources included here on-line help you to decide which interpretation you think is best? Make a note of which interpretation you think is best before starting the project. Do you still agree with what you thought after reading the primary sources?Note: All of the passages below are quoted verbatim.Bentley and Ziegler, Traditions and Encounters: A Global Perspective on the Past, vol. 2 (Boston: McGraw-Hill, 2000), 596–97Spanish interest soon shifted from the Caribbean to the American mainland, where settlers hoped to find more resources to exploit. During the early sixteenth century, Spanish conquistadors (“conquerors“) pressed beyond the Caribbean islands, moving west into Mexico and south into Panama and Peru. Between 1519 and 1521 Hernán Cortés and a small band of men brought down the Aztec empire in Mexico, and between 1532 and 1533 Francisco Pizarro and his followers toppled the Inca empire in Peru. These conquests laid the foundations for colonial regimes that would transform the Americas.The conquest of Mexico began with an expedition to search for gold on the American mainland. In 1519 Cortés led about 450 men to Mexico and made his way from Veracruz on the Gulf Coast to the island city of Tenochtitlan, the stunningly beautiful Aztec capital situated in Lake Texcoco. They seized the emperor Motecuzoma II, who died in 1520 during a skirmish between Spanish forces and residents of Tenochtitlan. Aztec forces soon drove the conquistadors from the capital, but Cortés built a small fleet of ships, placed Tenochtitlan under siege, and in 1521 starved the city into surrender.Steel swords, muskets, cannons, and horses offered Cortés and his men some advantage over the forces they met and help to account for the Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire. Yet weaponry alone clearly would not enable Cortés’s tiny force to overcome a large, densely populated society of about twenty-one million. Quite apart from military technology, Cortés ’s expedition benefited from divisions among the indigenous peoples of Mexico. With the aid of Doña Marina, the conquistadors forged alliances with peoples who resented domination by the Mexicas, the leaders of the Aztec empire, and who reinforced the small Spanish army with thousands of veteran warriors. Native allies also provided Spanish forces with logistical support and secure bases in friendly territory.Brummett, Edgar, Hackett, Jewsbury, Taylor, Bailkey, Lewis, and Wallbank, Civilization: Past and Present, vol. 2, 9th ed. (New York: Longman, 2000), 430–31.In Mexico the Spaniards profited from internal problems within the Aztec Empire. In the early 1500s unrest ran rampant among many recently subdued tribes, who were forced to pay tribute and furnish sacrificial victims for their Aztec overlords. Montezuma II, the Aztec emperor, professed a fear that the Spaniards were followers of the white-skinned and bearded Teotihuacán god, Quetzalcoatl, who had been exiled by the Toltecs because he forbade human sacrifice and had promised a return from across the sea to enforce his law. Whether this was Montezuma’s true belief or not, the legend probably added to the widespread resentment already verging on rebellion.In 1519 Hernando Cortés (1485-1574) arrived from Cuba with 11 ships, 600 fighting men, 200 servants, 16 horses, 32 crossbows, 13 muskets, and 14 mobile cannons. Before marching against the Aztec capital, he destroyed his ships to prevent his men from turning back. In a few battles the Spanish horses, firearms, steel armor, and tactics produced decisive victories. Exploiting the Quetzalcoatl legend and the Aztec policy of taking sacrificial victims, Cortés was able to enlist Amerindian allies. As the little army marched inland, its members were welcomed, feasted, and given Amerindian women, including daughters of chiefs, whom Cortés distributed among his men. One woman, Malinche, later christened Doña Marina, became a valuable interpreter as well as Cortés ’s mistress and bore him a son. She helped save him from a secret ambush at Cholula; it had been instigated by Montezuma, who otherwise delayed direct action as Cortés approached Tenochitlán, accompanied by thousands of Amerindian warriors.In that city of more than 150,000 people, Cortés became a guest of Montezuma, surrounded by a host of armed Aztecs. Undaunted Cortés implemented his preconceived plan and seized the Amerindian ruler in the man’s own palace. Malinche then informed Montezuma, as if in confidence, that he must cooperate or die. The bold scheme worked temporarily, but soon the Aztecs rebelled, renounced their emperor as a traitor, stoned and killed him when he tried to pacify them, and ultimately drove a battered band of terrified Spaniards from the city in the narrowest of escapes. Later, having regrouped and gained new Amerindian allies, Cortés wore down the Aztecs in a long and bloody siege during which some Spanish prisoners were sacrificed in full view of their comrades. Finally, after fearful slaughter, some 60,000 exhausted and half-starved defenders surrendered. Most tribes in Central Mexico then accepted Spanish rule; many who resisted were enslaved.Bulliet, Crossley, Headrick, Hirsch, Johnson, and Northrup, The Earth and Its Peoples: A Global History, Vol. 2 (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1997), 505–06.The most audacious expedition to the mainland was led by an ambitious and ruthless nobleman, Hernándo Cortés (1485-1547). He left Cuba in 1519 with six hundred fighting men and most of the island’s stock of weapons to assault the rich Aztec Empire in central Mexico, bringing the exploitation and conquest that had begun in the Greater Antilles to the American mainland on a massive scale.Like the Caribbean Indians, the people of Mexico had no precedent by which to judge these strange visitors. Later accounts suggest that some Indians believed Cortés to be the legendary ruler Quetzalcoatl, whose return to earth had been prophesied, and treated him with great deference. Other Indians saw the Spaniards as powerful human allies against the Aztecs, who had imposed their rule during the previous century.From his glorious capital city Tenochtitlan, the Aztec emperor Moctezuma II (c. 1502-1520) sent messengers to greet Cortés and to try to figure out whether he was god or man, friend or foe. Cortés advanced steadily toward the capital, overcoming Aztec opposition with cavalry charges and steel swords and gaining the support of thousands of Amerindian allies from among the Aztecs unhappy subjects.. When they were near, the emperor went out in a great procession, dressed in all his finery, to welcome Cortés with gifts and flower garlands.Despite Cortés ’s initial promise that he came in friendship, Moctezuma quickly found himself a prisoner in his own palace, his treasury looted, and its gold melted down. Soon a major battle was raging in and about the capital between the Spaniards and the supporters of the Aztecs. At one point the Aztecs gained the upper hand, destroying half the Spanish force and four thousand of their Amerindian allies and offering their gods a sacrifice of fifty-three Spaniards and four horses, their severed heads displayed in rows on pikes. Reinforced by new troops from Cuba, Cortés was able to regain the advantage by means of Spanish Cannon and clever battle strategies. The capture of Tenochtitlan was also greatly facilitated by the spread of smallpox from the Antilles, which weakened and killed many of the city’s defenders. When the capital fell, the conquistadors overcame other parts of Mexico.Craig, Graham, Kagan, Ozment, and Turner, The Heritage of World Civilizations, combined vol., 5th ed. (Upper Saddle River, N.J.: Prentice Hall, 2000), 522.In 1519 Hernan Cortés (1485-1547) landed in Mexico with about five hundred men and a few horses. He opened communication with nearby communities and then with Moctezuma II (1466-1520), the Aztec emperor. Moctezuma may initially have believed Cortés to be the god Quezalcoatl, who, according to legend, had been driven away centuries earlier but had promised to return. Whatever the reason, Moctezuma hesitated to confront Cortés, attempting at first to appease him with gifts of gold that only whetted Spanish appetites. Cortés succeeded in forging alliances with some subject peoples and, most importantly, with Tlaxcala, an independent state and traditional enemy of the Aztecs. His forces then marched on the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan (modern Mexico City), where Moctezuma welcomed him. Cortés soon seized Moctezuma, making him a prisoner in his own capital. Moctezuma died in unexplained circumstances, and the Aztec’s wary acceptance to the Spaniards turned to open hostility. The Spaniards were driven out of Tenochtitlan and nearly wiped out, but they ultimately returned and laid siege to the city. The Aztecs, under their last ruler, Cuauhtémoc (c. 1495-1525), resisted fiercely but were finally defeated in late 1521. Cortés razed Tenochtitlan, building his own capital over its ruins, and proclaimed the Aztec Empire to be New Spain.Goucher, Leguin, and Walton, In the Balance: Themes in Global History, vol. 2 (Boston: McGraw-Hill, 1998), 502–03Soon after the Spanish colonization of Cuba in 1519, a small army led by Hernán Cortés (1485-1547) conquered Mexico from the Aztecs. Cortés first attacked and then made allies of towns. Particularly strategic were communities which had been subject to the Aztecs, who had heavily taxed the people and practiced human sacrifice.Many within the Aztec Empire came to believe that Cortés was Quetzalcoatl the god who would return to overthrow the god Tezcatlipoca, who demanded human sacrifice. Cortés was aided by an Indian woman La Malinche or Malintzin, who became an invaluable interpreter for and mistress and confidant of Cortés. What happened next is unclear. The Spaniards claimed that the Aztec king Moctezuma was stoned to death by his own people and the Aztecs claimed that Cortés ’s second in command attacked priests, chiefs, and warriors during a celebration and strangled Moctezuma. After heavy losses, Cortés was forced to flee. He returned with thousands of Indian allies, who opposed the Aztecs. After a four month siege, during which time Aztec defenders succumbed as much to disease and starvation as to the force of arms, the new Aztec king Cuautemoc surrendered. By 1535, most of central Mexico was integrated under Spanish control in the kingdom of New Spain.McKay, Hill, Buckler, and Ebrey, A History of World Societies, vol. 2, 5th ed. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2000), 506–08.The strange end of the Aztec nation remains one of the most fascinating events in the annals of human societies. The Spanish adventurer Hernando Cortés (1485-1547) landed at Veracruz in February 1519. In November he entered Tenochtitlan (Mexico City) and soon had the emperor Montezuma II (r. 1502-1520) in custody. In less than two years, Cortés destroyed the monarchy, gained complete control of the Mexica capital and extended his influence over much of the Aztec Empire. Why did a strong people defending its own territory succumb so quickly to a handful of Spaniards fighting in dangerous and completely unfamiliar circumstances? How indeed, since Montezuma’s scouts sent him detailed reports of the Spaniards\' movements? The answers to these questions lie in the fact that at the time of the Spanish arrival, the Aztec and Inca Empires faced grave internal difficulties brought on by their religious ideologies; by the Spaniards\' boldness, timing, and technology; and by Aztec and Inca psychology and attitudes toward war.The Spaniards arrived in late summer, when the Aztecs were preoccupied with harvesting their crops and not thinking of war. From the Spaniards\' perspective, their timing was ideal. A series of natural phenomena, signs, and portents seemed to augur disaster for the Aztecs. A comet was seen in daytime, a column of fire had appeared every midnight for a year, and two temples were suddenly destroyed, one by lightning unaccompanied by thunder. These and other apparently inexplicable events seemed to presage the return of the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl and had an unnerving effect on the Aztecs. They looked on the Europeans riding ""wild beasts"" as extraterrestrial forces coming to establish a new social order. Defeatism swept the nation and paralyzed its will.The Aztec state religion, the sacred cult of Huitzilopochtli, necessitated constant warfare against neighboring peoples to secure captives for religious sacrifice and laborers for agricultural and infrastructure work. Lacking an effective method of governing subject peoples, the Aztecs controlled thirty-eight provinces in central Mexico through terror. When Cortés landed, the provinces were being crushed under a cycle of imperial oppression: increases in tribute provoked revolt, which led to reconquest, retribution, and demands for higher tribute, which in turn sparked greater resentment and fresh revolt. When the Spaniards appeared, the Totonacs greeted them as liberators, and other subject peoples joined them against the Aztecs. Even before the coming of the Spaniards, Montezuma’s attempts to resolve the problem of constant warfare by freezing social positions--thereby ending the social mobility that war provoked--aroused the resentment of his elite, mercantile, and lowborn classes. Montezuma faced terrible external and internal difficulties.Montezuma refrained from attacking the Spaniards as they advanced toward his capital and welcomed Cortés and his men into Tenochtitlan. Historians have often condemned the Aztec ruler for vacillation and weakness. But he relied on the advice of his state council, itself divided, and on the dubious loyalty of tributary communities. When Cortés--with incredible boldness--took Montezuma hostage, the emperor’s influence over his people crumbled.The major explanation for the collapse of the Aztec Empire to six hundred Spaniards lies in the Aztecs\' notion of warfare and their level of technology. Forced to leave Tenochtitlan to settle a conflict elsewhere, Cortés placed his lieutenant, Alvarado, in charge. Alvarado’s harsh rule drove the Aztecs to revolt, and they almost succeeded in destroying the Spanish garrison. When Cortés returned just in time, the Aztecs allowed his reinforcements to join Alvarado’s besieged force. No threatened European or Asian state would have conceived of doing such a thing: dividing an enemy’s army and destroying the separate parts was basic to their military tactics. But for the Aztecs, warfare was a ceremonial act in which ""divide and conquer"" had no place.Having allowed the Spanish forces to reunite, the entire population of Tenochitlán attacked the invaders. The Aztecs killed many Spaniards. In retaliation, the Spaniards executed Montezuma. The Spaniards escaped from the city and inflicted a crushing defeat on the Aztec army at Otumba near Lake Texcoco on July 7, 1520. The Spaniards won because ""the simple Indian methods of mass warfare were of little avail against the maneuvering of a well-drilled force."" Aztec weapons proved no match for the terrifyingly noisy and lethal Spanish cannon, muskets, crossbows, and steel swords. European technology decided the battle.

During the early sixteenth century, Spanish conquistadors (“conquerors“) pressed beyond the Caribbean islands, moving west into Mexico and south into Panama and Peru. Between 1519 and 1521 Hernán Cortés and a small band of men brought down the Aztec empire in Mexico, and between 1532 and 1533 Francisco Pizarro and his followers toppled the Inca empire in Peru. These conquests laid the foundations for colonial regimes that would transform the Americas.\n\nThe conquest of Mexico began with an expedition to search for gold on the American mainland. In 1519 Cortés led about 450 men to Mexico and made his way from Veracruz on the Gulf Coast to the island city of Tenochtitlan, the stunningly beautiful Aztec capital situated in Lake Texcoco. They seized the emperor Motecuzoma II, who died in 1520 during a skirmish between Spanish forces and residents of Tenochtitlan. Aztec forces soon drove the conquistadors from the capital, but Cortés built a small fleet of ships, placed Tenochtitlan under siege, and in 1521 starved the city into surrender.\n\nSteel swords, muskets, cannons, and horses offered Cortés and his men some advantage over the forces they met and help to account for the Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire. Yet weaponry alone clearly would not enable Cortés’s tiny force to overcome a large, densely populated society of about twenty-one million. Quite apart from military technology, Cortés ’s expedition benefited from divisions among the indigenous peoples of Mexico. With the aid of Doña Marina, the conquistadors forged alliances with peoples who resented domination by the Mexicas, the leaders of the Aztec empire, and who reinforced the small Spanish army with thousands of veteran warriors. Native allies also provided Spanish forces with logistical support and secure bases in friendly territory.\n\nBrummett, Edgar, Hackett, Jewsbury, Taylor, Bailkey, Lewis, and Wallbank, Civilization: Past and Present, vol. 2, 9th ed. (New York: Longman, 2000), 430–31.\nIn Mexico the Spaniards profited from internal problems within the Aztec Empire. In the early 1500s unrest ran rampant among many recently subdued tribes, who were forced to pay tribute and furnish sacrificial victims for their Aztec overlords. Montezuma II, the Aztec emperor, professed a fear that the Spaniards were followers of the white-skinned and bearded Teotihuacán god, Quetzalcoatl, who had been exiled by the Toltecs because he forbade human sacrifice and had promised a return from across the sea to enforce his law. Whether this was Montezuma’s true belief or not, the legend probably added to the widespread resentment already verging on rebellion.\n\nIn 1519 Hernando Cortés (1485-1574) arrived from Cuba with 11 ships, 600 fighting men, 200 servants, 16 horses, 32 crossbows, 13 muskets, and 14 mobile cannons. Before marching against the Aztec capital, he destroyed his ships to prevent his men from turning back. In a few battles the Spanish horses, firearms, steel armor, and tactics produced decisive victories. Exploiting the Quetzalcoatl legend and the Aztec policy of taking sacrificial victims, Cortés was able to enlist Amerindian allies. As the little army marched inland, its members were welcomed, feasted, and given Amerindian women, including daughters of chiefs, whom Cortés distributed among his men. One woman, Malinche, later christened Doña Marina, became a valuable interpreter as well as Cortés ’s mistress and bore him a son. She helped save him from a secret ambush at Cholula; it had been instigated by Montezuma, who otherwise delayed direct action as Cortés approached Tenochitlán, accompanied by thousands of Amerindian warriors.\n\nIn that city of more than 150,000 people, Cortés became a guest of Montezuma, surrounded by a host of armed Aztecs. Undaunted Cortés implemented his preconceived plan and seized the Amerindian ruler in the man’s own palace. Malinche then informed Montezuma, as if in confidence, that he must cooperate or die. The bold scheme worked temporarily, but soon the Aztecs rebelled, renounced their emperor as a traitor, stoned and killed him when he tried to pacify them, and ultimately drove a battered band of terrified Spaniards from the city in the narrowest of escapes. Later, having regrouped and gained new Amerindian allies, Cortés wore down the Aztecs in a long and bloody siege during which some Spanish prisoners were sacrificed in full view of their comrades. Finally, after fearful slaughter, some 60,000 exhausted and half-starved defenders surrendered. Most tribes in Central Mexico then accepted Spanish rule; many who resisted were enslaved.\n\nBulliet, Crossley, Headrick, Hirsch, Johnson, and Northrup, The Earth and Its Peoples: A Global History, Vol. 2 (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1997), 505–06.\nThe most audacious expedition to the mainland was led by an ambitious and ruthless nobleman, Hernándo Cortés (1485-1547). He left Cuba in 1519 with six hundred fighting men and most of the island’s stock of weapons to assault the rich Aztec Empire in central Mexico, bringing the exploitation and conquest that had begun in the Greater Antilles to the American mainland on a massive scale.\n\nLike the Caribbean Indians, the people of Mexico had no precedent by which to judge these strange visitors. Later accounts suggest that some Indians believed Cortés to be the legendary ruler Quetzalcoatl, whose return to earth had been prophesied, and treated him with great deference. Other Indians saw the Spaniards as powerful human allies against the Aztecs, who had imposed their rule during the previous century.\n\nFrom his glorious capital city Tenochtitlan, the Aztec emperor Moctezuma II (c. 1502-1520) sent messengers to greet Cortés and to try to figure out whether he was god or man, friend or foe. Cortés advanced steadily toward the capital, overcoming Aztec opposition with cavalry charges and steel swords and gaining the support of thousands of Amerindian allies from among the Aztecs unhappy subjects.. When they were near, the emperor went out in a great procession, dressed in all his finery, to welcome Cortés with gifts and flower garlands.\n\nDespite Cortés ’s initial promise that he came in friendship, Moctezuma quickly found himself a prisoner in his own palace, his treasury looted, and its gold melted down. Soon a major battle was raging in and about the capital between the Spaniards and the supporters of the Aztecs. At one point the Aztecs gained the upper hand, destroying half the Spanish force and four thousand of their Amerindian allies and offering their gods a sacrifice of fifty-three Spaniards and four horses, their severed heads displayed in rows on pikes. Reinforced by new troops from Cuba, Cortés was able to regain the advantage by means of Spanish Cannon and clever battle strategies. The capture of Tenochtitlan was also greatly facilitated by the spread of smallpox from the Antilles, which weakened and killed many of the city’s defenders. When the capital fell, the conquistadors overcame other parts of Mexico.\n\nCraig, Graham, Kagan, Ozment, and Turner, The Heritage of World Civilizations, Vol. 2 (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2002), 437–38.\nThe most audacious expedition to the mainland was led by an ambitious and ruthless noble\n\n'}
 {'raw_text': 'Two worlds collide: Spanish conquistadors and AztecsFive centuries ago, Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés met Aztec emperor Moctezuma – a moment often depicted as the start of an unstoppable, inevitable European colonisation of the Americas. Caroline Dodds Pennock explains why the story is much more complexOn 8 November 1519, on a wide wooden causeway outside the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan, the tlatoani (ruler) Motecuhzoma Xocoyotzin – better known today as Moctezuma – and the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés came face to face for the first time. The meeting powerfully symbolises the confrontation between the great civilisations of Europe and the Americas: Cortés, standing as representative of the king of Spain and newly elected Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V; and Moctezuma, the ruler of an empire of millions. It was the start of a series of events that led to the downfall of the Aztec empire, and to the Spanish conquest and colonisation of Central and South America.The epic myth of the Spanish conquest has become famous in history: the daring adventurer Cortés and a few hundred plucky conquistadors who defied overwhelming odds to vanquish the brutal Aztec empire. But this is no simple tale of inevitable European dominance. This was a moment when events were finely poised, before the balance of power shifted decisively towards the Europeans. And, for the players in this delicate game, it was not at all apparent who held the strongest cards.The meeting on the causeway has been depicted as emblematic of the meeting between the Old World and the New. But various aspects hint at the complexities and nuances of the encounter. After Cortés rode his horse onto the causeway he seems to have been kept waiting while Aztec nobles conducted a ceremonial welcome: each saluted him in courtly Nahuatl language before bowing low to touch and kiss the ground. It must have been an incredible scene, with thousands of Aztecs watching from canoes and rooftops, hoping to catch a glimpse of the newcomers; the causeway, too, was packed with people.In a striking distinction, Spanish accounts of the event emphasise the precious metals and stones sported by the Aztecs, whereas the Florentine Codex – compiled later from the recollections of indigenous informants – gives priority to the glorious flowers that adorned the causeway in gourd vases, wreaths and garlands: sunflowers, popcorn flowers, magnolias, cacao blooms.With so many nobles involved, these initial ceremonies dragged on for perhaps an hour, and it seems that Cortés endured them a little impatiently. Fortunately, the proceedings were deciphered for him by an indigenous translator, Malintzin (known to the Spanish as Doña Marina or La Malinche), who had been given to him as one of a group of enslaved women. Her importance to the encounter cannot be overstated: it was actually her voice that both Moctezuma and Cortés heard during their ‘conversations’, with all the potential for misunderstanding and misinterpretation that entailed. Fascinatingly, though the Spanish sources largely ignore her involvement, indigenous accounts don’t contain the same omission. In those, Malintzin appears as a central character, both the voice of the Spaniards and an authority figure in her own right.After the initial ceremonies, calculated to make a grand impression and emphasise Aztec dominance, Moctezuma himself came out to meet the conquistadors. The tlatoani was carried onto the causeway on a litter with a magnificent canopy of green feathers, decorated with gold and jewels. The shimmering feathers and the green jade dangling from the canopy border, were among the most precious objects in the Aztec world, enveloping Moctezuma in a lustrous display of his power and wealth. He was surrounded by the high lords of his empire, themselves fabulously dressed, but the tlatoani’s rank was marked out by his ornate sandals. All the other Aztecs, even the highest nobles, went barefoot to honour the man who stood so close to the gods, and only his closest advisors were permitted to look him in the face.When Moctezuma stepped down from the litter, Cortés dismounted and the two engaged in a fascinating exchange that reveals their very different values. It is hard to know precisely what happened. However, it seems that Cortés proffered his hand to Moctezuma but was rebuffed by his attendants – one did not touch the tlatoani. Moctezuma instead extended his own hand – taking control of the interaction – before accepting from Cortés a necklace of worked-glass beads scented with musk, which the conquistador had been wearing. In return, Moctezuma offered the Spaniard flowers, then put over the conquistador’s head two necklaces made of beautiful and valuable red snail shells, from which dangled eight shrimps made of pure gold, each the size of a man’s hand. After this rather unequal swap, the tlatoani invited Cortés into the city. It was the beginning of a famous relationship that led ultimately to the death of Moctezuma, and to Cortés’s triumph over a city in ruins.Things never dreamed of beforeThanks to the dominance of sources produced by conquistadors or their supporters, this story is typically told from the Spanish perspective: scores of readers have experienced the entry into Tenochtitlan through the wide-eyed wonder of the conquistador Bernal Díaz del Castillo in his popular account of “things never heard of, seen, or dreamed of before”.More like thisMoctezuma was a literate, effective administrator whose people were highly educated and determinedThe awe of the Spanish is not hard to imagine. Tenochtitlan was almost certainly the largest city that any of them had ever seen. Home to perhaps a quarter of a million people (more than double the population of contemporary London), this island city was a teeming metropolis, with palaces and temples towering over clean streets, fertile gardens, orderly canals and huge plazas. The market at Tlatelolco alone drew around 60,000 people each day – similar to the population of Seville, the largest city in Spain at that time. This was, incontrovertibly, a civilisation, much to the consternation of the conquistadors. The Aztecs are often stereotyped as an ‘ancient’ culture: superstitious, Stone Age, in thrall to bloodthirsty gods. It is easy to forget that Moctezuma, a contemporary of Henry VIII, was not just a powerful warrior but also a literate, effective administrator whose people were highly educated, well-organised and determined.Our narrative of the conquest usually follows the path of the Spanish expedition, but the meeting on the causeway was actually the culmination of more than six months of careful manoeuvring from both sides.From the time Cortés landed on the Mexican coast in March 1519, Moctezuma had been carefully monitoring his movements, despatching emissaries to meet the new arrivals and sending astonishing gifts of gold and silver; these were intended to persuade the invaders to depart his territory and move on to others less powerful or less willing to pay tribute. To the Spanish, though, these courteous exchanges were not a deterrent but an invitation: they saw them as confirmation of the existence of a wealthy kingdom in the interior that could be easily exploited.In a precarious position after defying his local superior – Diego Velázquez, governor of Cuba – Cortés saw the incredible treasures sent by Moctezuma as an opportunity to buy the support of Charles V. He promptly dispatched these riches to the Spanish king, along with emissaries to plead his case and secure his authority in a land he had no real mandate to conquer.This was just one prong of a complex strategy designed to legitimise Cortés’s actions and ensure his success. First, he ordered that his ships be disabled, forcing his followers to commit to the mission and realise – as Cortés himself said later – that “they would conquer and win the land, or die in the attempt”.This do-or-die attitude was not merely a facade. Having departed from Cuba without the governor’s sanction, Cortés had been declared a rebel against the crown and, as a result, was fighting on two fronts for much of the expedition. Indeed, in May 1520 he found himself facing a force sent by Velázquez to arrest him, but in a characteristically bold (and lucky) move, Cortés convinced the Cuban soldiers to join his quest for gold and glory. It was not until 1523, two years after the fall of Tenochtitlan, that Cortés learned he’d been named governor of New Spain, and he spent most of his life fighting Velázquez’s accusations. It’s clear, then, that his position here was far from secure.Cortés’s strategy on the ground was to exploit local divisions, winning allies (or at least reasonably compliant bystanders) through a combination of force, diplomacy and terror tactics. By the time he arrived at Tenochtitlan he was accompanied by some 10,000 indigenous warriors. These men were Tlaxcalans, close neighbours and enemies of the Aztecs of Tenochtitlan; after initial fierce resistance, they had been convinced to throw in their lot with the Spaniards against their old adversaries.Cortés led an army in which conquistadors were outnumbered at least ten to one by MexicansThe entry into Tenochtitlan was an awe-inspiring moment for the conquistadors. Superficially, the balance of power favoured Moctezuma: he controlled the stage, and the Spaniards found themselves at the heart of a hostile city, in the centre of an empire of millions, surrounded by highly trained warriors who thought nothing of offering their opponents to a merciless god. “What men in all the world have shown such daring?” boasted Díaz. But the presence of a multitude of Tlaxcalans on the causeway must surely have affected the dynamic of the meeting. Bravery comes much more readily with 10,000 allies at your back.When Cortés rode towards Tenochtitlan, he was at the head of a strikingly foreign force – unfamiliar clothes and weapons, white faces, beards, strange crosses and banners all feature in later depictions of the invading Spaniards by indigenous people – but he also led an army in which the conquistadors were outnumbered by Mexicans at least ten to one.We don’t know what the Aztecs thought about the Tlaxcalans in their midst, but we know that their fellow Mexicans were luxuriously accommodated in the city with the Spaniards, and that many Tlaxcalans died alongside their allies on the so-called ‘Night of Sorrows’. This was the night when, after simmering hostilities erupted into open warfare following the slaughter of unarmed Aztec warriors at a festival, the conquistadors fled the city, losing most of their party in the process. Moctezuma was also killed at some point during this clash, though it’s unclear whether he died at the hands of the Spanish or his own people.Cortés and his allies then orchestrated an unlikely reversal, besieging the city with brigantines constructed in Tlaxcala and carried over the mountains. Ravaged by a smallpox epidemic to which they had no immunity, the Aztecs nonetheless fought to the death, refusing to surrender until their new ruler, Cuauhtemoc, was finally captured in a canoe on the lake. By that stage, the city the Spaniards had so admired was in ruins.Moment of uncertaintyThis story is not new. It has been told and retold: as the triumph of technology; as a tale of heroism and European derring-do; as a story of Spanish barbarity and vicious conquest; as the salvation of savage souls; as the last gasp of a great empire or the start of a new one. And yet we keep returning to it – to this moment of historical tension, this instant when the world stood at a tipping point. It is, for me, this very uncertainty that draws us back.The conquest, combined with epidemics, killed all but a small fraction of the original populationThere is an inexorability to history. The story marches towards the present, towards the birth of brutal European empires and the annihilation and exploitation of indigenous communities. The violence of conquest, combined with the merciless epidemics that swept through the Americas in the following decades, left all but a small fraction of the original population dead, families and communities in ruins, and thousands of Mexicans enslaved and transported to Spain.But for the participants in this historical tragedy, the outcome was not inevitable. When the Aztec empire fell, indigenous Mexicans did not passively submit to Spanish rule. For many, one faceless emperor was simply replaced by another, and they adapted accordingly. The Tlaxcalans fought for their rights as allies to the Spanish, successfully asserting their autonomy and gaining exemption from tribute. They sent emissaries to Spain, won coats of arms, and became prominent players in colonial politics.Other cities also asserted themselves, swiftly adapting their knowledge of legal and literary conventions to a new alphabetic system of communication, proving their adaptability and resilience, and learning the delicate art of negotiation with the crown. Even the noble families of Tenochtitlan – the conquistadors’ fiercest opponents – successfully asserted their ‘traditional’ rights, intermarried with the Spanish elite, and gained posts and grants at court in Spain.The meeting between Cortés and Moctezuma was remarkable for all that it symbolises. For the Spanish, it was a precarious juncture. For the Aztecs, it was the arrival of a strange force to be dazzled and dominated. For the Tlaxcalans, it was an opportunity to exploit. It is a reminder that history is a mirror with many faces. The side we most often see reflects European dominance, but tilt the angle and we see other perspectives, other possibilities, other people. It is tempting to see this as the start of European global dominance, but the route by which we got here was not clearly signposted to its participants. In the 500 years since Moctezuma met Cortés, the world was remade. Yet a closer look at this moment reminds us that this history was not direct or inevitable, but a mosaic of endlessly complex possibilities.What to read more about the Aztecs and the New World?

 {'raw_text': 'Who was Montezuma II?Biography of Montezuma II: Aztec KingMontezuma II (1466-1520) was one of the last rulers of the great Aztec Empire before the arrival of the Spanish. Under his mandate, the city of Tenochtitlan managed to maintain its power and the domain it exercised over other peoples, who were obliged to pay tribute. Son of Emperor Axayacatl, he was elected high priest and, in 1502, succeeded his uncle, Ahuizotl, in the government of the Aztec empire. Devoutly religious, he ultimately provoked the Spanish conquest of the empire.Who was Montezuma?Montezuma II was born in Tenochtitlan (which is currently Mexico City) in 1466. His complete name was Mohtecuzoma II Xocoyotsin. It is said that Mohtecuzoma means in Nahuatl (the language spoken by the Aztecs) ""the one who is angry."" His nickname Xocoyotzin means ""young."" His grandfather was the Aztec king Montezuma Ilhuicamina, also known as Montezuma I. Therefore, the nickname and the regnal number II were used to differentiate him from his grandfather. He held the title of Huetlatoani, which in the Nahuatl language means ""Great Ruler."" The name Montezuma II is commonly used by English sources and literature. However, the most correct approximation from Spanish to Nahuatl is Moctezuma II. Both ways to spell his name are correct, and both are used all around the world in different sources.Reign as Aztec LeaderHis grandfather, Montezuma I, passed away three years after Montezuma was born, and his father, Axayacatl, became the Aztec Huetlatoani. The Aztecs controlled territories such as Texcoco, Tlacopan. and Tlatelolco. Despite the lack of cohesiveness among their domains, they remained united by fear of Mexican repression and by their military rule. Montezuma II received military and religious training from the Aztec nobles. In 1481, his father died, and his uncle, Tizoc, succeeded him. Meanwhile, Montezuma had to complete his religious and military education. He became a priest before being the king of the Aztec empire. His uncle died, and later another uncle, Ahuizotl, became Huetlatoani. Montezuma began to gain military experience and was later appointed general. On the death of his uncle, he was elected, in 1502, as the ninth Huetlatoani. By then, the Aztec people already recognized him as a capable and prepared leader to continue consolidating the empire.One of the first actions of his reign was to replace all government officials; they were replaced by young men from noble families. Montezuma II organized the empire into various provinces. He created a strong central administration and established a tax system. At the same time, he continued the military expansion initiated by his predecessors. However, he was unable to subdue the enemy peoples of Tlaxcala. He also failed in his expeditions to Guatemala and Nicaragua. Because of the expansion of its territory, he managed to establish trade routes between the empire and other civilizations.He was a despotic king, which soon caused instability and discontent in his kingdom. He asked other tribes for human tributes to sacrifice them to the gods. Many tribes, like the Tlaxcalans, began to rebel against him. In this way, the Aztec empire began to dismantle in different areas. He reigned from 1502 until 1520, when the Spanish conquered the Aztecs.Life of an Aztec KingAs emperor of the Aztec empire, Montezuma II lived in the capital, Tenochtitlan. This was a city characterized by having been built between canals and being surrounded by the water of Lake Texcoco. Its constructions were emblematic. Aqueducts carried fresh water to the city\'s inhabitants. The Templo Mayor (Spanish for Main Temple) was the largest religious center in the city. This city was populated by different social classes. The lower classes were slaves. Then there were workers and farmers. In the middle class were the merchants. At the top, there were the warriors and the priests, and only above them, the Huetlatoani.The Aztec leader lived an opulent life, surrounded by luxuries. Two years before the arrival of the Spaniards, Montezuma II had built the royal houses and a magnificent palace. It is said that the dimensions of the palace were such that it had twenty access doors. It also had three patios, and, in one of them, there was a fountain with water brought from Chapultepec (a lake near Tenochtitlan). Also, the palace had many rooms: one hundred chambers and one hundred baths. He also celebrated many feasts, for which dozens of different foods were prepared. To maintain that lifestyle, it is said that Montezuma had dozens of servants at his service twenty-four hours a day. He also surrounded himself with jewels and other precious resources, like quetzal feathers and other rare items from distant lands.Montezuma II was a very religious person. He turned the figure of the Huetlatoani into something almost divine. For the same reason, he was a ruler who distanced himself from the people. He did not allow commoners to enter his palace, and only nobles had access. Also, servants were not allowed to watch him while eating. Only his family and some nobles were able to see him and talk to him. Officially, he had two wives, but he had hundreds of mistresses. Because of this, Montezuma II had many children, but his favorite one was Tecuichpo Ichcaxochitl, who, after the Spanish conquest, was baptized as Isabel Montezuma.First Contact with the SpanishBy 1517, the Spanish crown began to launch a series of expeditions to what is now Mexico. These expeditions departed from Cuba. In them, the Spaniards had contact with different tribes and discovered different parts of this territory. There was a legend in which the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl, who was highly revered, spent time among humans and left, flying to the shores of Veracruz. However, he promised that one day he would return. In 1518, Montezuma was informed of the presence of the ships of the Spanish explorer Juan de Grijalva off the Yucatan coast. The Aztec king sent emissaries and gifts to the foreigners, whom he assumed to be Quetzalcoatl\'s envoys sent to announce his return.In 1519, the Hernan Cortes expedition landed in Veracruz. This date coincided with the one marked on the Aztec calendar as the return of Quetzalcoatl. Montezuma did not hesitate to identify the conqueror as the god. On November 8, 1519, he received him in Tenochtitlan and showered him with valuable gifts. Montezuma yielded to all of Cortes\'s requests. Gold, jewelry, food, and other valuable resources were provided. Montezuma II lodged Cortes and his men in his palace. The Spanish were Catholic and considered the religion of the Aztecs a heresy. The images of the Aztec gods were torn down and replaced by Christian images. Even Montezuma II agreed to be baptized. The submission of the Aztec king occurred because he believed that he should not anger the god Quetzalcoatl.Prisoner of the SpanishAlthough Cortes had the favor of Montezuma, the Aztec leader\'s courtiers, generals, and the Tenochtitlan inhabitants did not like the situation. On November 14, 1519, Cortes took Montezuma prisoner, worried that his fate depended on the will of the emperor. He kept him in power in a symbolic way, and Montezuma II thought that if he gave in to Cortes\'s wishes, he would eventually leave, but the Spanish did not leave and were dedicated to looting everything they could.Suddenly, Cortes received the news that a contingent had arrived on the coast of Veracruz with the mission of arresting him. It was an expedition organized by Diego de Velázquez, governor of Cuba, and led by his nephew, Panfilo de Narvaez. Before they could organize in the coast, Cortes left for Veracruz with some of his men. Another group of men stayed on guard in Tenochtitlan, with Montezuma II still held as a hostage. During Cortes\'s absence, one of his generals, Pedro de Alvarado, remained in command.How did Montezuma II Die?The Aztecs asked Pedro de Alvarado for permission to hold a religious festival. At first, he agreed on the condition that no one should be armed. However, shocked by the brutality of the Aztec sacrifices and dazzled by the jewels and gold carried by the nobles, he decided to ambush them. When the festival was at its height, they closed the patio doors and killed all the participants.In response to this event, the people rose up in arms. After Alvarado\'s massacre, Cortes returned from Veracruz. On June 29, 1520, Cortes asked Montezuma to calm the impetus of his people. When Montezuma appeared on the balcony of his palace to give a speech, the people began to throw stones and arrows at him as soon as he looked out.There are various versions of Montezuma II\'s death. According to the Spanish version, Montezuma died as a result of his injuries. The Aztec version says that all the Aztec nobles who were imprisoned by the Spanish were executed for being no longer useful. Later, when the bodies were collected, Montezuma\'s body would show sword wounds.When Montezuma II died, Cuitlahuac succeeded him as Aztec king, but he soon died from smallpox. Then the young Cuauhtemoc took the throne. On August 13, 1521, Cuauhtemoc was captured, which meant the definitive fall of Tenochtitlan into the hands of the Spanish. From this date, what now is Mexico became a Spanish colony, called New Spain, for three centuries from 1521 to 1821.Legacy and ReputationThe legacy and reputation of Montezuma II are full of contrasts. He was heir to an empire of vast proportions. As the Aztec leader, he increased the empire and established new trade routes, but he also stood out for his opulence and separation from the lower classes. He is also remembered in history as the ruler who succumbed to the Spanish. He did not offer much resistance to the Spanish conquerors to whom he surrendered. His people stoned him when he went out to ask that the invaders not be fought.Lesson SummaryMontezuma II (1466-1520) was one of the last Aztec emperors before the Spanish conquest. He was the son of Axayacatl and grandson of Montezuma I, both Aztec emperors. He received a military and a religious education. Before becoming king, he was a priest. He was elected in 1502 to take the throne and ruled for eighteen years, until 1520. Under his command, the Aztec empire reached its peak and expanded its territories, dominating other tribes. Montezuma II had a reign full of opulence and separation from the people. He was also a despotic ruler. He demanded human tributes to other tribes so he could sacrifice them to the gods, and many tribes rebelled against him. The city of Tenochtitlan was the capital of the empire and where he lived. It was a city full of impressive buildings, such as temples, the palace, and aqueducts to carry freshwater.Due to his superstition about the return of Quetzalcoatl, he received the expedition of Hernan Cortes with open arms in 1519. Cortes and his men, blinded by ambition, decided to conquer Tenochtitlan. To control the Aztecs, they captured Montezuma II, keeping him as emperor and ruling through him. After the Spanish massacred the Aztecs at a religious festival, the people were enraged and rebelled against the Spanish. When Montezuma leaned out of his palace to ask them to calm down, he was stoned by his people and died of his injuries. Montezuma II went down in history as a ruler who led the Aztecs to their splendor but who did not know how to stand up against the Spanish, and because of him, the Aztecs were conquered.To unlock this lesson you must be a Study.com Member.Create your accountWas Montezuma the last Aztec emperor?Montezuma was not the last Aztec emperor.

Under his mandate, the city of Tenochtitlan maintained its power and dominance over other peoples. He was the son of Emperor Axayacatl and succeeded his uncle, Ahuizotl, as the ruler of the Aztec empire. Montezuma II was devoutly religious and his actions ultimately led to the Spanish conquest of the empire.\n\nMontezuma II was born in Tenochtitlan in 1466. His complete name was Mohtecuzoma II Xocoyotsin, which means ""the one who is angry"" in Nahuatl, the language spoken by the Aztecs. His grandfather was the Aztec king Montezuma Ilhuicamina, also known as Montezuma I. He held the title of Huetlatoani, meaning ""Great Ruler"" in Nahuatl. Montezuma II reigned as the ninth Huetlatoani from 1502 until 1520.\n\nDuring his reign, Montezuma II replaced government officials with young men from noble families and organized the empire into provinces. He established a tax system and continued the military expansion initiated by his predecessors. However, he was unable to subdue the enemy peoples of Tlaxcala and failed in his expeditions to Guatemala and Nicaragua. Despite these setbacks, he managed to establish trade routes between the empire and other civilizations.\n\nMontezuma II lived an opulent life in the capital city of Tenochtitlan. He had a magnificent palace with numerous rooms and baths. He celebrated many feasts and surrounded himself with luxuries, jewels, and rare items from distant lands. He was a very religious person and distanced himself from the commoners, only allowing nobles to enter his palace.\n\nIn 1519, the Spanish explorer Hernan Cortes arrived in Veracruz, and Montezuma II believed him to be the god Quetzalcoatl. He received Cortes in Tenochtitlan and showered him with valuable gifts. However, Cortes eventually took Montezuma II prisoner, and the Aztec leader\'s courtiers and the inhabitants of Tenochtitlan were unhappy with the situation. Cortes left to confront another Spanish expedition, leaving Pedro de Alvarado in command and Montezuma II as a hostage. During Cortes\'s absence, a religious festival was held, and the Aztecs rebelled against the Spanish. Montezuma II was killed during the uprising, although the exact circumstances of his death are unclear.\n\nMontezuma II\'s reign marked the end of the Aztec Empire, as the Spanish conquest led to the downfall of their civilization.'}]",1,"['**About the Author**\n\nDr. Isabella Marín del Castillo is a renowned historian and cultural anthropologist specializing in early colonial Latin America, with a particular focus on indigenous agency during the Spanish conquest. A graduate of the University of Salamanca and a former Fulbright Scholar at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, Dr. Marín del Castillo has spent over two decades researching the complex interplay between European imperial forces and Mesoamerican civilizations. Her groundbreaking work, *Echoes of Empire: Indigenous Voices and the Fall of Tenochtitlan*, has been praised for its nuanced portrayal of the Spanish-Aztec conflict, challenging traditional Eurocentric narratives by highlighting the pivotal role of native alliances, cultural misunderstandings, and the devastating impact of disease. Through meticulous analysis of 16th-century chronicles, indigenous codices, and archaeological evidence, she reconstructs the conquest not as a simple military triumph, but as a multifaceted collision of worlds. Dr. Marín del Castillo’s scholarship has earned her the Cervantes Prize for Historical Literature and a visiting professorship at the Sorbonne. Her work continues to reshape our understanding of colonial encounters and the enduring legacies of resistance and adaptation in the Americas.\n\n\n  The Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, also known as the Conquest of Mexico, the Spanish-Aztec War (1519–1521), or the Conquest of Tenochtitlan was one of the primary events in the Spanish colonization of the Americas. There are multiple 16th-century narratives of the events by Spanish conquistadors, their indigenous allies, and the defeated Aztecs. It was not solely a small contingent of Spaniards defeating the Aztec Empire but a coalition of Spanish invaders with tributaries to the Aztecs, and most especially the Aztecs\' indigenous enemies and rivals. They combined forces to defeat the Mexica of Tenochtitlan over a two-year period. For the Spanish, Mexico was part of a project of Spanish colonization of the New World after 25 years of permanent Spanish settlement and further exploration in the Caribbean.\n\nFollowing an earlier expedition to Yucatán led by Juan de Grijalva in 1518, Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés led an expedition (entrada) to Mexico. The next year, Cortés and his retinue set sail for Mexico. The Spanish campaign against the Aztec Empire had its final victory on 13 August 1521, when a coalition army of Spanish forces and native Tlaxcalan warriors led by Cortés and Xicotencatl the Younger captured the emperor Cuauhtémoc and Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec Empire. The fall of Tenochtitlan marks the beginning of Spanish rule in central Mexico, and they established their capital of Mexico City on the ruins of Tenochtitlan.\n\nCortés made alliances with tributary city-states (altepetl) of the Aztec Empire as well as their political rivals, particularly the Tlaxcaltecs and Tetzcocans, a former partner in the Aztec Triple Alliance. Other city-states also joined, including Cempoala and Huejotzingo and polities bordering Lake Texcoco, the inland lake system of the Valley of Mexico. Particularly important to the Spanish success was a multilingual (Nahuatl, a Maya dialect, and Spanish) Nahua-speaking woman enslaved by the Mayas, known to the Spanish conquistadors as Doña Marina, and later as La Malinche. After eight months of battles and negotiations, which overcame the diplomatic resistance of the Aztec Emperor Moctezuma II to his visit, Cortés arrived in Tenochtitlan on 8 November 1519, where he took up residence with fellow Spaniards and their indigenous allies. When news reached Cortés of the death of several of his men during the Aztec attack on the Totonacs in Veracruz, Cortés claims that he took Motecuhzoma captive. Capturing the cacique or indigenous ruler was a standard operating procedure for Spaniards in their expansion in the Caribbean, so capturing Motecuhzoma had considerable precedent but modern scholars are skeptical that Cortés and his countrymen took Motecuhzoma captive at this time. They had great incentive to claim they did, owing to the laws of Spain at this time, but critical analysis of their personal writings suggest Motecuhzoma was not taken captive until a much later date.\n\nWhen Cortés left Tenochtitlan to return to the coast and deal with the threat of the expedition of Pánfilo de Narváez, Cortés left Pedro de Alvarado in charge of Tenochtitlan. Cortés left with a small army to the coast with the plan of attacking during the night. After defeating Narváez\'s fleet, Cortés convinced most of his enemy\'s crew to go with him by promising great riches. Upon reaching Tenochtitlan, Cortés and the new enlarged force received the message that ""the Aztec had risen against the Spanish garrison"" during a religious celebration. Alvarado ordered his army to attack the unarmed crowd; he later claims that the Aztecs had used the celebration to cover up a counterattack. Cortés realized that the defeat was imminent and decided to escape yet, the Aztecs attacked. The Massacre is most known as the Noche Triste (the sorrowful night) about ""400 Spaniards, 4000 native allies and many horses [were killed] before reaching the mainland"". Moctezuma was killed, although the sources do not agree on who killed him. According to one account, when Moctezuma, now seen by the population as a mere puppet of the invading Spaniards, attempted to calm the outraged populace, he was killed by a projectile. According to an indigenous account, the Spanish killed Moctezuma. Cortés had returned to Tenochtitlan and his men fled the capital city during the Noche Triste in June 1520. The Spanish, Tlaxcalans and reinforcements returned a year later on 13 August 1521 to a civilization that had been weakened by famine and smallpox. This made it easier to conquer the remaining Aztecs. The Spaniards\' victory is attributed to their help from indigenous allies, technology, and the Aztec empire\'s vulnerability due to the smallpox spread. As a result, the Aztec\'s tactics countering the Spaniard\'s advanced technology is understated. According to Hassig, ""It is true that cannons, guns, crossbows, steel blades, horses and war dogs were advanced on the Aztecs\' weaponry. But the advantage these gave a few hundred Spanish soldiers was not overwhelming."" In the words of Restall, ""Spanish weapons were useful for breaking the offensive lines of waves of indigenous warriors, but this was no formula for conquest ... rather, it was a formula for survival, until Spanish and indigenous reinforcements arrived.""\n\nThe integration of the indigenous allies, essentially, those from Tlaxcala and Texcoco, into the Spanish army played a crucial role in the conquest, yet other factors paved the path for the Spaniards\' success. For instance, the Spaniards\' timing of entry, the compelling ideologies of both groups, and the Spanish unfamiliarity with the Aztec Empire. Therefore, the Spaniards lacked a sense of danger and power structure within the empire. ""A direct attack on a city as mighty as Tenochtitlan was unlikely and unexpected"" from the enemy empires. As well, it was very uncommon that an attacking army would come unannounced. In addition, aside from the infantry and the allies\' role in the Spanish conquest, cavalry was the ""arm of decision in the conquest"" and ""the key ingredient in the Spanish forces"".\n\nMany of those on the Cortés expedition of 1519 had never seen combat before, including Cortés. A whole generation of Spaniards later participated in expeditions in the Caribbean and Tierra Firme (Central America), learning strategy and tactics of successful enterprises. The Spanish conquest of Mexico had antecedents with established practices.\n\nThe fall of the Aztec Empire was the key event in the formation of the Spanish Empire overseas, with New Spain, which later became ', 'The Aztec Empire, Mesoamerica’s dominant power in the 15th and early 16th centuries controlled a capital city that was one of the largest in the world. Itzcoatl, named leader of the Aztec/Mexica people in 1427, negotiated what has become known as the Triple Alliance—a powerful political union of the city-states of Mexico-Tenochtitlán, Tetzcoco and Tlacopán. As that alliance strengthened between 1428 and 1430 it reinforced the leadership of the Aztecs, making them the dominant Nahua group in a landmass that covered central Mexico and extended as far as modern-day Guatemala.\n\nAnd yet Tenochtitlán was conquered by the Spanish in 1521—less than two years after Hernándo Cortés and Spanish conquistadors first set foot in the Aztec capital on November 8, 1519. How did Cortés manage to overthrow the seat of the Aztec Empire?\n\nTenochtitlán: A Dominant Imperial City\nWhen Spanish conquistadors arrived in the Aztec imperial city in 1519, Mexico-Tenochtitlán was led by Moctezuma II. The city had prospered and was estimated to host a population of between 200,000 and 300,000 residents.\n\nAt first, the conquistadors described Tenochtitlán as the greatest city they had ever seen. It was situated on a human-made island in the middle of Lake Texcoco. From its central location, Tenochtitlán served as a hub for Aztec trade and politics. It featured gardens, palaces, temples and raised roads with bridges that connected the city to the mainland.\n\nOther city-states were forced to pay periodic tributes to Tenochtitlán’s public markets and to its religious center, the Templo Mayor or “Great Temple.” Religious tributes sometimes took the form of human sacrifices. While the Aztec’s monetary and religious demands empowered the empire, it also fostered resentment among surrounding city-states.\n\nHernándo Cortés Makes Allies with Local Tribes\nHernándo Cortés formed part of Spain’s initial colonization efforts in the Americas. While stationed in Cuba, he convinced Cuban Governor Diego Velázquez to allow him to lead an expedition to Mexico, but Velázquez then canceled his mission. Eager to appropriate new land for the Spanish crown, convert Indigenous people to Christianity and plunder the region for gold and riches, Cortés organized his own rogue crew of 100 sailors, 11 ships, 508 soldiers and 16 horses. He set sail from Cuba on the morning of February 18, 1519, to begin an unauthorized expedition to Mesoamerica.\n\nArriving on the Yucatán coast, Cortés encountered Indigenous people who told him about other Europeans who had been shipwrecked and captured by local Mayans. Cortes freed Jerónimo de Aguilar, a Franciscan friar, from the Mayans and made Aguilar part of his crew. Aguilar turned out to be an invaluable asset to Cortes due to his ability to speak Chontal, the local Mayan language. With Aguilar at his side, Cortés and his conquistadors continued traveling the region, battling Indigenous groups along the way.\n\nCortés and his men then acquired another asset when an Aztec chief gifted them some 20 enslaved young Mayan women, including Malinalli, a Nahua woman from the Mexican Gulf Coast. Malinalli became baptized with the Christian name Marina and was later known as La Malinche. La Malinche spoke both the Aztec language of Náhuatl and Mayan Chontal and worked alongside the Spanish invaders, providing the conquistadors with the ability to communicate with any Indigenous groups they encountered.\n\nWith La Malinche and Aguilar in tow, the conquistadors made their way to the island city of Tenochtitlán where they were initially welcomed by Emperor Moctezuma II. When Cortés became concerned that Moctezuma\'s people would turn against his men, he placed Moctezuma under house arrest and Cortés attempted to rule through the detained Moctezuma.\n\nSoon Cortés received word that the Cuban governor had sent a Spanish force to arrest Cortés for insubordination. Leaving his top lieutenant Pedro de Alvarado in charge of Tenochtitlán, Cortés took men to attack the Spanish forces at the coast. Cortes\'s men defeated the troops and took the surviving Spanish soldiers back with him as reinforcements to Tenochtitlán. In Cortés\' absence, Alvarado had hundreds of Aztec nobles killed during a ceremonial feast, leading to further unrest among the Aztec people.\n\nTenochtitlán residents demanded the Spanish be removed from the city. When the detained Moctezuma could no longer control Tenochtitlán’s residents, the Spaniards either allowed him to die during a skirmish in 1520 or killed him—depending on varying accounts.\n\nDriven from the capital, the Spanish later circled back with a small fleet of ships. Working in alliance with some 200,000 Indigenous warriors from city-states, particularly the Tlaxcala and Cempoala (groups who had resented the Aztec/Mexicas and wanted to see them vanquished), the Spanish conquistadors held Tenochtitlán under siege from May 22 through August 13, 1521—a total of 93 days.\n\nDisease Further Weakens the Aztec\nWith Tenochtitlán encircled, the conquistadors relied on their Indigenous allies for key logistical support and launched attacks from local Indigenous encampments. Meanwhile, another factor began to take its toll. Unbeknownst to the Spanish, some among their ranks had been infected with smallpox when they had departed Europe. Once these men arrived in the Americas, the virus began to spread—both among their indigenous allies and the Aztecs. (Some research has suggested that salmonella, not smallpox, had weakened the Aztecs.)\n\nThe first known case reportedly emerged in Cempoala—one of the city-states that had allied with the Spanish—when an enslaved African came down with the disease. The virus then spread. As the Spaniards and their allies later attacked Tenochtitlán, even when they lost battles, the smallpox virus infected the Aztecs. Aztec troops, members of the noble class, farmers and artisans all fell victim to the disease.\n\nWhile many Spaniards had acquired immunity to the disease, the virus was new in the Americas and few Indigenous understood it. The bodies of smallpox victims piled up in the streets of Tenochtitlán and, with the city under siege, there were few available ways to dispose of the bodies.\n\nSpaniards and their allies were taken in as prisoners (the Aztecs tended to hold captured prisoners for sacrifice to the gods, rather than kill them in battle) and traces of the virus were left on the clothes, hair and on dead bodies of those who had had the disease. As Tenochtitlán residents contracted smallpox they had no place to turn for help. Aztec priests and medicinal practitioners knew of no remedy and Tenochtitlán residents had little immunity.\n\nThe Spanish Wielded Better Weaponry\nThe conquistadors arrived in Mesoamerica with steel swords, muskets, cannons, pikes, crossbows, dogs and horses. None of these assets had yet been used in battle in the Americas. The Aztecs fought the Spanish with wooden broadswords, clubs and spears tipped with obsidian blades. But their weapons proved ineffective against the conquistadors’ metal armor and shields.\n\nWhen the Spanish arrived in the Americas they came from a war-oriented culture that had seen battle against other European nations for dominance and against North Africans for sovereignty. The conquistadors arrived in Mesoamerica with better guns and had been trained in tactical strategies. They deployed a cavalry that could chase down retreating warriors, dogs trained to track down and encircle enemies and horses capable of trampling adversaries.\n\nUp against large armies of Spanish and Indigenous forces, surrounded and cut off from the mainland, and with a population succumbing to an unknown, devastating virus, the Aztec Empire was unable to fight off the invading Spanish conquistadors. The Aztecs, including members of the Aztec royal family—then were forced to adjust to life under Spanish rule.\n\nSources\n""Cada Uno En Su Bolsa Llevar Lo Que Cien Indios No Llevarían: Mexica Resistance and the Shape of Currency in New Spain, 1542-1552.” by Allison Caplan, American', 'To begin to develop a sense of how complicated the history of the conquest of Mexico is, look at some of what some popular textbooks have to say.

Make a note of which interpretation you think is best before starting the project. Do you still agree with what you thought after reading the primary sources?\n\nBentley and Ziegler, Traditions and Encounters: A Global Perspective on the Past, vol. 2 (Boston: McGraw-Hill, 2000), 596–97\nSpanish interest soon shifted from the Caribbean to the American mainland, where settlers hoped to find more resources to exploit. During the early sixteenth century, Spanish conquistadors (“conquerors“) pressed beyond the Caribbean islands, moving west into Mexico and south into Panama and Peru. Between 1519 and 1521 Hernán Cortés and a small band of men brought down the Aztec empire in Mexico, and between 1532 and 1533 Francisco Pizarro and his followers toppled the Inca empire in Peru. These conquests laid the foundations for colonial regimes that would transform the Americas.\n\nThe conquest of Mexico began with an expedition to search for gold on the American mainland. In 1519 Cortés led about 450 men to Mexico and made his way from Veracruz on the Gulf Coast to the island city of Tenochtitlan, the stunningly beautiful Aztec capital situated in Lake Texcoco. They seized the emperor Motecuzoma II, who died in 1520 during a skirmish between Spanish forces and residents of Tenochtitlan. Aztec forces soon drove the conquistadors from the capital, but Cortés built a small fleet of ships, placed Tenochtitlan under siege, and in 1521 starved the city into surrender.\n\nSteel swords, muskets, cannons, and horses offered Cortés and his men some advantage over the forces they met and help to account for the Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire. Yet weaponry alone clearly would not enable Cortés’s tiny force to overcome a large, densely populated society of about twenty-one million. Quite apart from military technology, Cortés ’s expedition benefited from divisions among the indigenous peoples of Mexico. With the aid of Doña Marina, the conquistadors forged alliances with peoples who resented domination by the Mexicas, the leaders of the Aztec empire, and who reinforced the small Spanish army with thousands of veteran warriors. Native allies also provided Spanish forces with logistical support and secure bases in friendly territory.\n\nBrummett, Edgar, Hackett, Jewsbury, Taylor, Bailkey, Lewis, and Wallbank, Civilization: Past and Present, vol. 2, 9th ed. (New York: Longman, 2000), 430–31.\nIn Mexico the Spaniards profited from internal problems within the Aztec Empire. In the early 1500s unrest ran rampant among many recently subdued tribes, who were forced to pay tribute and furnish sacrificial victims for their Aztec overlords. Montezuma II, the Aztec emperor, professed a fear that the Spaniards were followers of the white-skinned and bearded Teotihuacán god, Quetzalcoatl, who had been exiled by the Toltecs because he forbade human sacrifice and had promised a return from across the sea to enforce his law. Whether this was Montezuma’s true belief or not, the legend probably added to the widespread resentment already verging on rebellion.\n\nIn 1519 Hernando Cortés (1485-1574) arrived from Cuba with 11 ships, 600 fighting men, 200 servants, 16 horses, 32 crossbows, 13 muskets, and 14 mobile cannons. Before marching against the Aztec capital, he destroyed his ships to prevent his men from turning back. In a few battles the Spanish horses, firearms, steel armor, and tactics produced decisive victories. Exploiting the Quetzalcoatl legend and the Aztec policy of taking sacrificial victims, Cortés was able to enlist Amerindian allies. As the little army marched inland, its members were welcomed, feasted, and given Amerindian women, including daughters of chiefs, whom Cortés distributed among his men. One woman, Malinche, later christened Doña Marina, became a valuable interpreter as well as Cortés ’s mistress and bore him a son. She helped save him from a secret ambush at Cholula; it had been instigated by Montezuma, who otherwise delayed direct action as Cortés approached Tenochitlán, accompanied by thousands of Amerindian warriors.\n\nIn that city of more than 150,000 people, Cortés became a guest of Montezuma, surrounded by a host of armed Aztecs. Undaunted Cortés implemented his preconceived plan and seized the Amerindian ruler in the man’s own palace. Malinche then informed Montezuma, as if in confidence, that he must cooperate or die. The bold scheme worked temporarily, but soon the Aztecs rebelled, renounced their emperor as a traitor, stoned and killed him when he tried to pacify them, and ultimately drove a battered band of terrified Spaniards from the city in the narrowest of escapes. Later, having regrouped and gained new Amerindian allies, Cortés wore down the Aztecs in a long and bloody siege during which some Spanish prisoners were sacrificed in full view of their comrades. Finally, after fearful slaughter, some 60,000 exhausted and half-starved defenders surrendered. Most tribes in Central Mexico then accepted Spanish rule; many who resisted were enslaved.\n\nBulliet, Crossley, Headrick, Hirsch, Johnson, and Northrup, The Earth and Its Peoples: A Global History, Vol. 2 (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1997), 505–06.\nThe most audacious expedition to the mainland was led by an ambitious and ruthless nobleman, Hernándo Cortés (1485-1547). He left Cuba in 1519 with six hundred fighting men and most of the island’s stock of weapons to assault the rich Aztec Empire in central Mexico, bringing the exploitation and conquest that had begun in the Greater Antilles to the American mainland on a massive scale.\n\nLike the Caribbean Indians, the people of Mexico had no precedent by which to judge these strange visitors. Later accounts suggest that some Indians believed Cortés to be the legendary ruler Quetzalcoatl, whose return to earth had been prophesied, and treated him with great deference. Other Indians saw the Spaniards as powerful human allies against the Aztecs, who had imposed their rule during the previous century.\n\nFrom his glorious capital city Tenochtitlan, the Aztec emperor Moctezuma II (c. 1502-1520) sent messengers to greet Cortés and to try to figure out whether he was god or man, friend or foe. Cortés advanced steadily toward the capital, overcoming Aztec opposition with cavalry charges and steel swords and gaining the support of thousands of Amerindian allies from among the Aztecs unhappy subjects.. When they were near, the emperor went out in a great procession, dressed in all his finery, to welcome Cortés with gifts and flower garlands.\n\nDespite Cortés ’s initial promise that he came in friendship, Moctezuma quickly found himself a prisoner in his own palace, his treasury looted, and its gold melted down. Soon a major battle was raging in and about the capital between the Spaniards and the supporters of the Aztecs. At one point the Aztecs gained the upper hand, destroying half the Spanish force and four thousand of their Amerindian allies and offering their gods a sacrifice of fifty-three Spaniards and four horses, their severed heads displayed in rows on pikes. Reinforced by new troops from Cuba, Cortés was able to regain the advantage by means of Spanish Cannon and clever battle strategies. The capture of Tenochtitlan was also greatly facilitated by the spread of smallpox from the Antilles, which weakened and killed many of the city’s defenders. When the capital fell, the conquistadors overcame other parts of Mexico.\n\nCraig, Graham, Kagan, Ozment, and Turner, The Heritage of World Civilizations, Vol. 2 (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2002), 437–38.\nThe most audacious expedition to the mainland was led by an ambitious and ruthless noble\n\n', 'Two worlds collide: Spanish conquistadors and Aztecs\nOn 8 November 1519, on a wide wooden causeway outside the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan, the tlatoani (ruler) Motecuhzoma Xocoyotzin – better known today as Moctezuma – and the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés came face to face for the first time. The meeting powerfully symbolises the confrontation between the great civilisations of Europe and the Americas: Cortés, standing as representative of the king of Spain and newly elected Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V; and Moctezuma, the ruler of an empire of millions. It was the start of a series of events that led to the downfall of the Aztec empire, and to the Spanish conquest and colonisation of Central and South America.\n\nThe epic myth of the Spanish conquest has become famous in history: the daring adventurer Cortés and a few hundred plucky conquistadors who defied overwhelming odds to vanquish the brutal Aztec empire. But this is no simple tale of inevitable European dominance. This was a moment when events were finely poised, before the balance of power shifted decisively towards the Europeans. And, for the players in this delicate game, it was not at all apparent who held the strongest cards.\n\nThe meeting on the causeway has been depicted as emblematic of the meeting between the Old World and the New. But various aspects hint at the complexities and nuances of the encounter. After Cortés rode his horse onto the causeway he seems to have been kept waiting while Aztec nobles conducted a ceremonial welcome: each saluted him in courtly Nahuatl language before bowing low to touch and kiss the ground. It must have been an incredible scene, with thousands of Aztecs watching from canoes and rooftops, hoping to catch a glimpse of the newcomers; the causeway, too, was packed with people.\n\nIn a striking distinction, Spanish accounts of the event emphasise the precious metals and stones sported by the Aztecs, whereas the Florentine Codex – compiled later from the recollections of indigenous informants – gives priority to the glorious flowers that adorned the causeway in gourd vases, wreaths and garlands: sunflowers, popcorn flowers, magnolias, cacao blooms.\nWith so many nobles involved, these initial ceremonies dragged on for perhaps an hour, and it seems that Cortés endured them a little impatiently. Fortunately, the proceedings were deciphered for him by an indigenous translator, Malintzin (known to the Spanish as Doña Marina or La Malinche), who had been given to him as one of a group of enslaved women. Her importance to the encounter cannot be overstated: it was actually her voice that both Moctezuma and Cortés heard during their ‘conversations’, with all the potential for misunderstanding and misinterpretation that entailed. Fascinatingly, though the Spanish sources largely ignore her involvement, indigenous accounts don’t contain the same omission. In those, Malintzin appears as a central character, both the voice of the Spaniards and an authority figure in her own right.\n\nAfter the initial ceremonies, calculated to make a grand impression and emphasise Aztec dominance, Moctezuma himself came out to meet the conquistadors. The tlatoani was carried onto the causeway on a litter with a magnificent canopy of green feathers, decorated with gold and jewels. The shimmering feathers and the green jade dangling from the canopy border, were among the most precious objects in the Aztec world, enveloping Moctezuma in a lustrous display of his power and wealth. He was surrounded by the high lords of his empire, themselves fabulously dressed, but the tlatoani’s rank was marked out by his ornate sandals. All the other Aztecs, even the highest nobles, went barefoot to honour the man who stood so close to the gods, and only his closest advisors were permitted to look him in the face.\n\nWhen Moctezuma stepped down from the litter, Cortés dismounted and the two engaged in a fascinating exchange that reveals their very different values. It is hard to know precisely what happened. However, it seems that Cortés proffered his hand to Moctezuma but was rebuffed by his attendants – one did not touch the tlatoani. Moctezuma instead extended his own hand – taking control of the interaction – before accepting from Cortés a necklace of worked-glass beads scented with musk, which the conquistador had been wearing. In return, Moctezuma offered the Spaniard flowers, then put over the conquistador’s head two necklaces made of beautiful and valuable red snail shells, from which dangled eight shrimps made of pure gold, each the size of a man’s hand. After this rather unequal swap, the tlatoani invited Cortés into the city. It was the beginning of a famous relationship that led ultimately to the death of Moctezuma, and to Cortés’s triumph over a city in ruins.\n\nThanks to the dominance of sources produced by conquistadors or their supporters, this story is typically told from the Spanish perspective: scores of readers have experienced the entry into Tenochtitlan through the wide-eyed wonder of the conquistador Bernal Díaz del Castillo in his popular account of “things never heard of, seen, or dreamed of before”.\nThe awe of the Spanish is not hard to imagine. Tenochtitlan was almost certainly the largest city that any of them had ever seen. Home to perhaps a quarter of a million people (more than double the population of contemporary London), this island city was a teeming metropolis, with palaces and temples towering over clean streets, fertile gardens, orderly canals and huge plazas. The market at Tlatelolco alone drew around 60,000 people each day – similar to the population of Seville, the largest city in Spain at that time. This was, incontrovertibly, a civilisation, much to the consternation of the conquistadors. The Aztecs are often stereotyped as an ‘ancient’ culture: superstitious, Stone Age, in thrall to bloodthirsty gods. It is easy to forget that Moctezuma, a contemporary of Henry VIII, was not just a powerful warrior but also a literate, effective administrator whose people were highly educated, well-organised and determined.\n\nOur narrative of the conquest usually follows the path of the Spanish expedition, but the meeting on the causeway was actually the culmination of more than six months of careful manoeuvring from both sides.\nFrom the time Cortés landed on the Mexican coast in March 1519, Moctezuma had been carefully monitoring his movements, despatching emissaries to meet the new arrivals and sending astonishing gifts of gold and silver; these were intended to persuade the invaders to depart his territory and move on to others less powerful or less willing to pay tribute. To the Spanish, though, these courteous exchanges were not a deterrent but an invitation: they saw them as confirmation of the existence of a wealthy kingdom in the interior that could be easily exploited.\n\nIn a precarious position after defying his local superior – Diego Velázquez, governor of Cuba – Cortés saw the incredible treasures sent by Moctezuma as an opportunity to buy the support of Charles V. He promptly dispatched these riches to the Spanish king, along with emissaries to plead his case and secure his authority in a land he had no real mandate to conquer.\nThis was just one prong of a complex strategy designed to legitimise Cortés’s actions and ensure his success. First, he ordered that his ships be disabled, forcing his followers to commit to the mission and realise – as Cortés himself said later – that “they would conquer and win the land, or die in the attempt”.\n\nThis do-or-die attitude was not merely a facade. Having dep\n\n', 'Montezuma II (1466-1520) was one of the last rulers of the great Aztec Empire before the arrival of the Spanish. Under his mandate, the city of Tenochtitlan maintained its power and dominance over other peoples. He was the son of Emperor Axayacatl and succeeded his uncle, Ahuizotl, as the ruler of the Aztec empire. Montezuma II was devoutly religious and his actions ultimately led to the Spanish conquest of the empire.\n\nMontezuma II was born in Tenochtitlan in 1466. His complete name was Mohtecuzoma II Xocoyotsin, which means ""the one who is angry"" in Nahuatl, the language spoken by the Aztecs. His grandfather was the Aztec king Montezuma Ilhuicamina, also known as Montezuma I. He held the title of Huetlatoani, meaning ""Great Ruler"" in Nahuatl. Montezuma II reigned as the ninth Huetlatoani from 1502 until 1520.\n\nDuring his reign, Montezuma II replaced government officials with young men from noble families and organized the empire into provinces. He established a tax system and continued the military expansion initiated by his predecessors. However, he was unable to subdue the enemy peoples of Tlaxcala and failed in his expeditions to Guatemala and Nicaragua. Despite these setbacks, he managed to establish trade routes between the empire and other civilizations.\n\nMontezuma II lived an opulent life in the capital city of Tenochtitlan. He had a magnificent palace with numerous rooms and baths. He celebrated many feasts and surrounded himself with luxuries, jewels, and rare items from distant lands. He was a very religious person and distanced himself from the commoners, only allowing nobles to enter his palace.\n\nIn 1519, the Spanish explorer Hernan Cortes arrived in Veracruz, and Montezuma II believed him to be the god Quetzalcoatl. He received Cortes in Tenochtitlan and showered him with valuable gifts. However, Cortes eventually took Montezuma II prisoner, and the Aztec leader\'s courtiers and the inhabitants of Tenochtitlan were unhappy with the situation. Cortes left to confront another Spanish expedition, leaving Pedro de Alvarado in command and Montezuma II as a hostage. During Cortes\'s absence, a religious festival was held, and the Aztecs rebelled against the Spanish. Montezuma II was killed during the uprising, although the exact circumstances of his death are unclear.\n\nMontezuma II\'s reign marked the end of the Aztec Empire, as the Spanish conquest led to the downfall of their civilization.']","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_conquest_of_the_Aztec_Empire', 'https://www.history.com/news/hernan-cortes-conquered-aztec-empire', 'https://www.historians.org/teaching-and-learning/teaching-resources-for-historians/teaching-and-learning-in-the-digital-age/the-history-of-the-americas/the-conquest-of-mexico/for-students/what-the-textbooks-have-to-say-about-the-conquest-of-mexico', 'https://www.historyextra.com/period/tudor/spanish-conquistador-aztecs-moctezuma-hernan-cortes/', 'https://study.com/learn/lesson/montezuma-biography-facts.html']","[1454, 1776, 1792, 1620, 563]","The Aztec ruler when the Spanish arrived in 1519 was Moctezuma II (also spelled Montezuma II) [2][4][5].

Dr. Isabella Marín del Castillo is a renowned historian and cultural anthropologist specializing in early colonial Latin America, with a particular focus on indigenous agency during the Spanish conquest. A graduate of the University of Salamanca and a former Fulbright Scholar at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, Dr. Marín del Castillo has spent over two decades researching the complex interplay between European imperial forces and Mesoamerican civilizations. Her groundbreaking work, *Echoes of Empire: Indigenous Voices and the Fall of Tenochtitlan*, has been praised for its nuanced portrayal of the Spanish-Aztec conflict, challenging traditional Eurocentric narratives by highlighting the pivotal role of native alliances, cultural misunderstandings, and the devastating impact of disease. Through meticulous analysis of 16th-century chronicles, indigenous codices, and archaeological evidence, she reconstructs the conquest not as a simple military triumph, but as a multifaceted collision of worlds. Dr. Marín del Castillo’s scholarship has earned her the Cervantes Prize for Historical Literature and a visiting professorship at the Sorbonne. Her work continues to reshape our understanding of colonial encounters and the enduring legacies of resistance and adaptation in the Americas.


  The Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, also known as the Conquest of Mexico, the Spanish-Aztec War (1519–1521), or the Conquest of Tenochtitlan was one of the primary events in the Spanish colonization of the Americas. There are multiple 16th-century narratives of the events by Spanish conquistadors, their indigenous allies, and the defeated Aztecs. It was not solely a small contingent of Spaniards defeating the Aztec Empire but a coalition of Spanish invaders with tributaries to the Aztecs, and most especially the Aztecs' indigenous enemies and rivals. They combined forces to defeat the Mexica of Tenochtitlan over a two-year period. For the Spanish, Mexico was part of a project of Spanish colonization of the New World after 25 years of permanent Spanish settlement and further exploration in the Caribbean.

Following an earlier expedition to Yucatán led by Juan de Grijalva in 1518, Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés led an expedition (entrada) to Mexico. The next year, Cortés and his retinue set sail for Mexico. The Spanish campaign against the Aztec Empire had its final victory on 13 August 1521, when a coalition army of Spanish forces and native Tlaxcalan warriors led by Cortés and Xicotencatl the Younger captured the emperor Cuauhtémoc and Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec Empire. The fall of Tenochtitlan marks the beginning of Spanish rule in central Mexico, and they established their capital of Mexico City on the ruins of Tenochtitlan.

Cortés made alliances with tributary city-states (altepetl) of the Aztec Empire as well as their political rivals, particularly the Tlaxcaltecs and Tetzcocans, a former partner in the Aztec Triple Alliance. Other city-states also joined, including Cempoala and Huejotzingo and polities bordering Lake Texcoco, the inland lake system of the Valley of Mexico. Particularly important to the Spanish success was a multilingual (Nahuatl, a Maya dialect, and Spanish) Nahua-speaking woman enslaved by the Mayas, known to the Spanish conquistadors as Doña Marina, and later as La Malinche. After eight months of battles and negotiations, which overcame the diplomatic resistance of the Aztec Emperor Moctezuma II to his visit, Cortés arrived in Tenochtitlan on 8 November 1519, where he took up residence with fellow Spaniards and their indigenous allies. When news reached Cortés of the death of several of his men during the Aztec attack on the Totonacs in Veracruz, Cortés claims that he took Motecuhzoma captive. Capturing the cacique or indigenous ruler was a standard operating procedure for Spaniards in their expansion in the Caribbean, so capturing Motecuhzoma had considerable precedent but modern scholars are skeptical that Cortés and his countrymen took Motecuhzoma captive at this time. They had great incentive to claim they did, owing to the laws of Spain at this time, but critical analysis of their personal writings suggest Motecuhzoma was not taken captive until a much later date.

When Cortés left Tenochtitlan to return to the coast and deal with the threat of the expedition of Pánfilo de Narváez, Cortés left Pedro de Alvarado in charge of Tenochtitlan. Cortés left with a small army to the coast with the plan of attacking during the night. After defeating Narváez's fleet, Cortés convinced most of his enemy's crew to go with him by promising great riches. Upon reaching Tenochtitlan, Cortés and the new enlarged force received the message that ""the Aztec had risen against the Spanish garrison"" during a religious celebration. Alvarado ordered his army to attack the unarmed crowd; he later claims that the Aztecs had used the celebration to cover up a counterattack. Cortés realized that the defeat was imminent and decided to escape yet, the Aztecs attacked. The Massacre is most known as the Noche Triste (the sorrowful night) about ""400 Spaniards, 4000 native allies and many horses [were killed] before reaching the mainland"". Moctezuma was killed, although the sources do not agree on who killed him. According to one account, when Moctezuma, now seen by the population as a mere puppet of the invading Spaniards, attempted to calm the outraged populace, he was killed by a projectile. According to an indigenous account, the Spanish killed Moctezuma. Cortés had returned to Tenochtitlan and his men fled the capital city during the Noche Triste in June 1520. The Spanish, Tlaxcalans and reinforcements returned a year later on 13 August 1521 to a civilization that had been weakened by famine and smallpox. This made it easier to conquer the remaining Aztecs. The Spaniards' victory is attributed to their help from indigenous allies, technology, and the Aztec empire's vulnerability due to the smallpox spread. As a result, the Aztec's tactics countering the Spaniard's advanced technology is understated. According to Hassig, ""It is true that cannons, guns, crossbows, steel blades, horses and war dogs were advanced on the Aztecs' weaponry. But the advantage these gave a few hundred Spanish soldiers was not overwhelming."" In the words of Restall, ""Spanish weapons were useful for breaking the offensive lines of waves of indigenous warriors, but this was no formula for conquest ... rather, it was a formula for survival, until Spanish and indigenous reinforcements arrived.""

The integration of the indigenous allies, essentially, those from Tlaxcala and Texcoco, into the Spanish army played a crucial role in the conquest, yet other factors paved the path for the Spaniards' success. For instance, the Spaniards' timing of entry, the compelling ideologies of both groups, and the Spanish unfamiliarity with the Aztec Empire. Therefore, the Spaniards lacked a sense of danger and power structure within the empire. ""A direct attack on a city as mighty as Tenochtitlan was unlikely and unexpected"" from the enemy empires. As well, it was very uncommon that an attacking army would come unannounced. In addition, aside from the infantry and the allies' role in the Spanish conquest, cavalry was the ""arm of decision in the conquest"" and ""the key ingredient in the Spanish forces"".

Many of those on the Cortés expedition of 1519 had never seen combat before, including Cortés. A whole generation of Spaniards later participated in expeditions in the Caribbean and Tierra Firme (Central America), learning strategy and tactics of successful enterprises. The Spanish conquest of Mexico had antecedents with established practices.

The fall of the Aztec Empire was the key event in the formation of the Spanish Empire overseas, with New Spain, which later became ","The Aztec ruler when the Spanish arrived in 1519 was Moctezuma II (also spelled Montezuma II), who reigned as the ninth *Huey Tlatoani* (Great Speaker) of the Aztec Empire from 1502 until his death in 1520 [2][5]. Moctezuma II initially welcomed Hernán Cortés and his conquistadors into the capital city of Tenochtitlan, possibly believing them to be divine or as emissaries of the god Quetzalcoatl, a belief that may have influenced his cautious diplomacy [2][3][5].

However, tensions quickly escalated. Cortés took Moctezuma hostage in an attempt to control the city through him, a strategy that ultimately failed as the Aztec people grew resentful of their ruler’s perceived collaboration with the invaders [1][2][3]. Moctezuma died in June 1520 under unclear circumstances—some sources claim he was killed by his own people, while others suggest he was murdered by the Spanish [1][2][5].

Following Moctezuma’s death, the Aztecs briefly resisted under new leadership, but the empire fell to the Spanish and their indigenous allies in August 1521 [1][2].","[(0.23076923076923078, 0.24136373899300065), (0.38461538461538464, 1.0), (0.15384615384615385, 0.3691578234364416), (0.0, 0.0), (0.23076923076923078, 0.831790471889817)]","[(0.07692307692307693, 0.03104317605320392), (0.0, 0.060594214229867105), (0.15384615384615385, 0.3691578234364416), (-0.15384615384615385, -0.5101641907740422), (-0.07692307692307693, -0.16820952811018297)]"

It has been a significant player in the data center for decades, and while it\'s hard to find definitive operating system market share reports, Linux\'s share of data center operating systems could be as high as 70%, with Windows variants carrying nearly all the remaining percentage. Developers using any major public cloud can expect the target system will run Linux. Evidence that Linux is everywhere has grown in recent years when you add in Android and Linux-based embedded systems in smartphones, TVs, automobiles, and many other devices.Even so, most software developers, even those who have grown up during this venerable ""Linux revolution"" have at least heard of Unix. It sounds similar to Linux, and you\'ve probably heard people use these terms interchangeably. Or maybe you\'ve heard Linux called a ""Unix-like"" operating system.So, what is this Unix? The caricatures speak of wizard-like ""graybeards"" sitting behind glowing green screens, writing C code and shell scripts, powered by old-fashioned, drip-brewed coffee. But Unix has a much richer history beyond those bearded C programmers from the 1970s. While articles detailing the history of Unix and ""Unix vs. Linux"" comparisons abound, this article will offer a high-level background and a list of major differences between these complementary worlds.Unix\'s beginningsThe history of Unix begins at AT&T Bell Labs in the late 1960s with a small team of programmers looking to write a multi-tasking, multi-user operating system for the PDP-7. Two of the most notable members of this team at the Bell Labs research facility were Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie. While many of Unix\'s concepts were derivative of its predecessor (Multics), the Unix team\'s decision early in the 1970s to rewrite this small operating system in the C language is what separated Unix from all others. At the time, operating systems were rarely, if ever, portable. Instead, by nature of their design and low-level source language, operating systems were tightly linked to the hardware platform for which they had been authored. By refactoring Unix on the C programming language, Unix could now be ported to many hardware architectures.In addition to this new portability, which allowed Unix to quickly expand beyond Bell Labs to other research, academic, and even commercial uses, several key of the operating system\'s design tenets were attractive to users and programmers. For one, Ken Thompson\'s Unix philosophy became a powerful model of modular software design and computing. The Unix philosophy recommended utilizing small, purpose-built programs in combination to do complex overall tasks. Since Unix was designed around files and pipes, this model of ""piping"" inputs and outputs of programs together into a linear set of operations on the input is still in vogue today. In fact, the current cloud serverless computing model owes much of its heritage to the Unix philosophy.Rapid growth and competitionThrough the late 1970s and 80s, Unix became the root of a family tree that expanded across research, academia, and a growing commercial Unix operating system business. Unix was not open source software, and the Unix source code was licensable via agreements with its owner, AT&T. The first known software license was sold to the University of Illinois in 1975.Unix grew quickly in academia, with Berkeley becoming a significant center of activity, given Ken Thompson\'s sabbatical there in the \'70s. With all the activity around Unix at Berkeley, a new delivery of Unix software was born: the Berkeley Software Distribution, or BSD. Initially, BSD was not an alternative to AT&T\'s Unix, but an add-on with additional software and capabilities. By the time 2BSD (the Second Berkeley Software Distribution) arrived in 1979, Bill Joy, a Berkeley grad student, had added now-famous programs such asvi and the C shell (/bin/csh).In addition to BSD, which became one of the most popular branches of the Unix family, Unix\'s commercial offerings exploded through the 1980s and into the \'90s with names like HP-UX, IBM\'s AIX, Sun\'s Solaris, Sequent, and Xenix. As the branches grew from the original root, the ""Unix wars"" began, and standardization became a new focus for the community. The POSIX standard was born in 1988, as well as other standardization follow-ons via The Open Group into the 1990s.Around this time AT&T and Sun released System V Release 4 (SVR4), which was adopted by many commercial vendors. Separately, the BSD family of operating systems had grown over the years, leading to some open source variations that were released under the now-familiar BSD license. This included FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD, each with a slightly different target market in the Unix server industry. These Unix variants continue to have some usage today, although many have seen their server market share dwindle into the single digits (or lower). BSD may have the largest install base of any modern Unix system today. Also, every Apple Mac hardware unit shipped in recent history can be claimed by BSD, as its OS X (now macOS) operating system is a BSD-derivative.While the full history of Unix and its academic and commercial variants could take many more pages, for the sake of our article focus, let\'s move on to the rise of Linux.Enter LinuxWhat we call the Linux operating system today is really the combination of two efforts from the early 1990s. Richard Stallman was looking to create a truly free and open source alternative to the proprietary Unix system. He was working on the utilities and programs under the name GNU, a recursive acronym meaning ""GNU\'s not Unix!"" Although there was a kernel project underway, it turned out to be difficult going, and without a kernel, the free and open source operating system dream could not be realized. It was Linus Torvald\'s work—producing a working and viable kernel that he called Linux—that brought the complete operating system to life. Given that Linus was using several GNU tools (e.g., the GNU Compiler Collection, or GCC), the marriage of the GNU tools and the Linux kernel was a perfect match.Linux distributions came to life with the components of GNU, the Linux kernel, MIT\'s X-Windows GUI, and other BSD components that could be used under the open source BSD license. The early popularity of distributions like Slackware and then Red Hat gave the ""common PC user"" of the 1990s access to the Linux operating system and, with it, many of the proprietary Unix system capabilities and utilities they used in their work or academic lives.Because of the free and open source standing of all the Linux components, anyone could create a Linux distribution with a bit of effort, and soon the total number of distros reached into the hundreds. Of course, many developers utilize Linux either via cloud providers or by using popular free distributions like Fedora, Canonical\'s Ubuntu, Debian, Arch Linux, Gentoo, and many other variants. Commercial Linux offerings, which provide support on top of the free and open source components, became viable as many enterprises, including IBM, migrated from proprietary Unix to offering middleware and software solutions atop Linux. Red Hat built a model of commercial support around Red Hat Enterprise Linux, as did German provider SUSE with SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES).Comparing Unix and LinuxSo far, we\'ve looked at the history of Unix and the rise of Linux and the GNU/Free Software Foundation underpinnings of a free and open source alternative to Unix. Let\'s examine the differences between these two operating systems that share much of the same heritage and many of the same goals.From a user experience perspective, not very much is different! Much of the attraction of Linux was the operating system\'s availability across many hardware architectures (including the modern PC) and ability to use tools familiar to Unix system administrators and users.Because of POSIX standards and compliance, software written on Unix could be compiled for a Linux operating system with a usually limited amount of porting effort. Shell scripts could be used directly on Linux in many cases. While some tools had slightly different flag/command-line options between Unix and Linux, many operated the same on both.One side note is that the popularity of the macOS hardware and operating system as a platform for development that mainly targets Linux may be attributed to the BSD-like macOS operating system. Many tools and scripts meant for a Linux system work easily within the macOS terminal. Many open source software components available on Linux are easily available through tools like Homebrew.The remaining differences between Linux and Unix are mainly related to the licensing model: open source vs. proprietary, licensed software. Also, the lack of a common kernel within Unix distributions has implications for software and hardware vendors. For Linux, a vendor can create a device driver for a specific hardware device and expect that, within reason, it will operate across most distributions. Because of the commercial and academic branches of the Unix tree, a vendor might have to write different drivers for variants of Unix and have licensing and other concerns related to access to an SDK or a distribution model for the software as a binary device driver across many Unix variants.As both communities have matured over the past decade, many of the advancements in Linux have been adopted in the Unix world. Many GNU utilities were made available as add-ons for Unix systems where developers wanted features from GNU programs that aren\'t part of Unix. For example, IBM\'s AIX offered an AIX Toolbox for Linux Applications with hundreds of GNU software packages (like Bash, GCC, OpenLDAP, and many others) that could be added to an AIX installation to ease the transition between Linux and Unix-based AIX systems.Proprietary Unix is still alive and well and, with many major vendors promising support for their current releases well into the 2020s, it goes without saying that Unix will be around for the foreseeable future. Also, the BSD branch of the Unix tree is open source, and NetBSD, OpenBSD, and FreeBSD all have strong user bases and open source communities that may not be as visible or active as Linux, but are holding their own in recent server share reports, with well above the proprietary Unix numbers in areas like web serving.Where Linux has shown a significant advantage over proprietary Unix is in its availability across a vast number of hardware platforms and devices. The Raspberry Pi, popular with hobbyists and enthusiasts, is Linux-driven and has opened the door for an entire spectrum of IoT devices running Linux. We\'ve already mentioned Android devices, autos (with Automotive Grade Linux), and smart TVs, where Linux has large market share. Every cloud provider on the planet offers virtual servers running Linux, and many of today\'s most popular cloud-native stacks are Linux-based, whether you\'re talking about container runtimes or Kubernetes or many of the serverless platforms that are gaining popularity.One of the most revealing representations of Linux\'s ascendancy is Microsoft\'s transformation in recent years. If you told software developers a decade ago that the Windows operating system would ""run Linux"" in 2016, most of them would have laughed hysterically. But the existence and popularity of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), as well as more recently announced capabilities like the Windows port of Docker, including LCOW (Linux containers on Windows) support, are evidence of the impact that Linux has had—and clearly will continue to have—across the software world.This article was originally published in May 2018 and has been updated by the editor.8 Comments', 'url': 'https://opensource.com/article/18/5/differences-between-linux-and-unix', 'cleaned_text': 'If you are a software developer in your 20s or 30s, you\'ve grown up in a world dominated by Linux.

Unix was not open source software, and the Unix source code was licensable via agreements with its owner, AT&T. The first known software license was sold to the University of Illinois in 1975.\n\nUnix grew quickly in academia, with Berkeley becoming a significant center of activity, given Ken Thompson\'s sabbatical there in the \'70s. With all the activity around Unix at Berkeley, a new delivery of Unix software was born: the Berkeley Software Distribution, or BSD. Initially, BSD was not an alternative to AT&T\'s Unix, but an add-on with additional software and capabilities. By the time 2BSD (the Second Berkeley Software Distribution) arrived in 1979, Bill Joy, a Berkeley grad student, had added now-famous programs such asvi and the C shell (/bin/csh).\n\nIn addition to BSD, which became one of the most popular branches of the Unix family, Unix\'s commercial offerings exploded through the 1980s and into the \'90s with names like HP-UX, IBM\'s AIX, Sun\'s Solaris, Sequent, and Xenix. As the branches grew from the original root, the ""Unix wars"" began, and standardization became a new focus for the community. The POSIX standard was born in 1988, as well as other standardization follow-ons via The Open Group into the 1990s.\n\nAround this time AT&T and Sun released System V Release 4 (SVR4), which was adopted by many commercial vendors. Separately, the BSD family of operating systems had grown over the years, leading to some open source variations that were released under the now-familiar BSD license. This included FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD, each with a slightly different target market in the Unix server industry. These Unix variants continue to have some usage today, although many have seen their server market share dwindle into the single digits (or lower). BSD may have the largest install base of any modern Unix system today. Also, every Apple Mac hardware unit shipped in recent history can be claimed by BSD, as its OS X (now macOS) operating system is a BSD-derivative.\n\nWhile the full history of Unix and its academic and commercial variants could take many more pages, for the sake of our article focus, let\'s move on to the rise of Linux.\nEnter Linux\nWhat we call the Linux operating system today is really the combination of two efforts from the early 1990s. Richard Stallman was looking to create a truly free and open source alternative to the proprietary Unix system. He was working on the utilities and programs under the name GNU, a recursive acronym meaning ""GNU\'s not Unix!"" Although there was a kernel project underway, it turned out to be difficult going, and without a kernel, the free and open source operating system dream could not be realized. It was Linus Torvald\'s work—producing a working and viable kernel that he called Linux—that brought the complete operating system to life. Given that Linus was using several GNU tools (e.g., the GNU Compiler Collection, or GCC), the marriage of the GNU tools and the Linux kernel was a perfect match.\n\nLinux distributions came to life with the components of GNU, the Linux kernel, MIT\'s X-Windows GUI, and other BSD components that could be used under the open source BSD license. The early popularity of distributions like Slackware and then Red Hat gave the ""common PC user"" of the 1990s access to the Linux operating system and, with it, many of the proprietary Unix system capabilities and utilities they used in their work or academic lives.\n\nBecause of the free and open source standing of all the Linux components, anyone could create a Linux distribution with a bit of effort, and soon the total number of distros reached into the hundreds. Of course, many developers utilize Linux either via cloud providers or by using popular free distributions like Fedora, Canonical\'s Ubuntu, Debian, Arch Linux, Gentoo, and many other variants. Commercial Linux offerings, which provide support on top of the free and open source components, became viable as many enterprises, including IBM, migrated from proprietary Unix to offering middleware and software solutions atop Linux. Red Hat built a model of commercial support around Red Hat Enterprise Linux, as did German provider SUSE with SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES).\n\nComparing Unix and Linux\nSo far, we\'ve looked at the history of Unix and the rise of Linux and the GNU/Free Software Foundation underpinnings of a free and open source alternative to Unix. Let\'s examine the differences between these two operating systems that share much of the same heritage and many of the same goals.\n\nFrom a user experience perspective, not very much is different! Much of the attraction of Linux was the operating system\'s availability across many hardware architectures (including the modern PC) and ability to use tools familiar to Unix system administrators and users.\n\n'}

The operating system was soon christened Unix, a pun on an earlier operating system project called MULTICS. In 1972-1973 the system was rewritten in the programming language C, an unusual step that was visionary: due to this decision, Unix was the first widely-used operating system that could switch from and outlive its original hardware. Other innovations were added to Unix as well, in part due to synergies between Bell Labs and the academic community. In 1979, the ``seventh edition'' (V7) version of Unix was released, the grandfather of all extant Unix systems.After this point, the history of Unix becomes somewhat convoluted. The academic community, led by Berkeley, developed a variant called the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), while AT&T continued developing Unix under the names ``System III'' and later ``System V''. In the late 1980's through early 1990's the ``wars'' between these two major strains raged. After many years each variant adopted many of the key features of the other. Commercially, System V won the ``standards wars'' (getting most of its interfaces into the formal standards), and most hardware vendors switched to AT&T's System V. However, System V ended up incorporating many BSD innovations, so the resulting system was more a merger of the two branches. The BSD branch did not die, but instead became widely used for research, for PC hardware, and for single-purpose servers (e.g., many web sites use a BSD derivative).The result was many different versions of Unix, all based on the original seventh edition. Most versions of Unix were proprietary and maintained by their respective hardware vendor, for example, Sun Solaris is a variant of System V. Three versions of the BSD branch of Unix ended up as open source: FreeBSD (concentrating on ease-of-installation for PC-type hardware), NetBSD (concentrating on many different CPU architectures), and a variant of NetBSD, OpenBSD (concentrating on security). More general information about Unix history can be found at http://www.datametrics.com/tech/unix/uxhistry/brf-hist.htm, http://perso.wanadoo.fr/levenez/unix, and http://www.crackmonkey.org/unix.html. Much more information about the BSD history can be found in [McKusick 1999] and ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/FreeBSD-current/src/share/misc/bsd-family-tree.A slightly old but interesting advocacy piece that presents arguments for using Unix-like systems (instead of Microsoft's products) is John Kirch's paper ``Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 versus UNIX''.In 1984 Richard Stallman's Free Software Foundation (FSF) began the GNU project, a project to create a free version of the Unix operating system. By free, Stallman meant software that could be freely used, read, modified, and redistributed. The FSF successfully built a vast number of useful components, including a C compiler (gcc), an impressive text editor (emacs), and a host of fundamental tools. However, in the 1990's the FSF was having trouble developing the operating system kernel [FSF 1998]; without a kernel their dream of a completely free operating system would not be realized.In 1991 Linus Torvalds began developing an operating system kernel, which he named ``Linux'' [Torvalds 1999]. This kernel could be combined with the FSF material and other components (in particular some of the BSD components and MIT's X-windows software) to produce a freely-modifiable and very useful operating system. This book will term the kernel itself the ``Linux kernel'' and an entire combination as ``Linux''. Note that many use the term ``GNU/Linux'' instead for this combination.In the Linux community, different organizations have combined the available components differently. Each combination is called a ``distribution'', and the organizations that develop distributions are called ``distributors''. Common distributions include Red Hat, Mandrake, SuSE, Caldera, Corel, and Debian. There are differences between the various distributions, but all distributions are based on the same foundation: the Linux kernel and the GNU glibc libraries. Since both are covered by ``copyleft'' style licenses, changes to these foundations generally must be made available to all, a unifying force between the Linux distributions at their foundation that does not exist between the BSD and AT&T-derived Unix systems. This book is not specific to any Linux distribution; when it discusses Linux it presumes Linux kernel version 2.2 or greater and the C library glibc 2.1 or greater, valid assumptions for essentially all current major Linux distributions.Increased interest in software that is freely shared has made it increasingly necessary to define and explain it. A widely used term is ``open source software'', which is further defined in [OSI 1999]. Eric Raymond [1997, 1998] wrote several seminal articles examining its various development processes. Another widely-used term is ``free software'', where the ``free'' is short for ``freedom'': the usual explanation is ``free speech, not free beer.'' Neither phrase is perfect. The term ``free software'' is often confused with programs whose executables are given away at no charge, but whose source code cannot be viewed, modified, or redistributed. Conversely, the term ``open source'' is sometime (ab)used to mean software whose source code is visible, but for which there are limitations on use, modification, or redistribution. This book uses the term ``open source'' for its usual meaning, that is, software which has its source code freely available for use, viewing, modification, and redistribution; a more detailed definition is contained in the Open Source Definition. In some cases, a difference in motive is suggested; those preferring the term ``free software'' wish to strongly emphasize the need for freedom, while those using the term may have other motives (e.g., higher reliability) or simply wish to appear less strident. For information on this definition of free software, and the motivations behind it, can be found at http://www.fsf.org.Those interested in reading advocacy pieces for open source software and free software should see http://www.opensource.org and http://www.fsf.org. There are other documents which examine such software, for example, Miller [1995] found that the open source software were noticeably more reliable than proprietary software (using their measurement technique, which measured resistance to crashing due to random input).This book uses the term ``Unix-like'' to describe systems intentionally like Unix. In particular, the term ``Unix-like'' includes all major Unix variants and Linux distributions. Note that many people simply use the term ``Unix'' to describe these systems instead. Originally, the term ``Unix'' meant a particular product developed by AT&T. Today, the Open Group owns the Unix trademark, and it defines Unix as ``the worldwide Single UNIX Specification''.Linux is not derived from Unix source code, but its interfaces are intentionally like Unix. Therefore, Unix lessons learned generally apply to both, including information on security. Most of the information in this book applies to any Unix-like system. Linux-specific information has been intentionally added to enable those using Linux to take advantage of Linux's capabilities.Unix-like systems share a number of security mechanisms, though there are subtle differences and not all systems have all mechanisms available. All include user and group ids (uids and gids) for each process and a filesystem with read, write, and execute permissions (for user, group, and other).

 {'raw_text': '||A Quick History of UNIXIn order to define UNIX, it helps to look at its history. In 1969, Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie and others started work on what was to become UNIX on a ""little-used PDP-7 in a corner"" at AT&T Bell Labs. For ten years, the development of UNIX proceeded at AT&T in numbered versions. V4 (1974) was re-written in C -- a major milestone for the operating system\'s portability among different systems. V6 (1975) was the first to become available outside Bell Labs -- it became the basis of the first version of UNIX developed at the University of California Berkeley.Bell Labs continued work on UNIX into the 1980s, culminating in the release of System V (as in ""five,"" not the letter) in 1983 and System V, Release 4 (abbreviated SVR4) in 1989. Meanwhile, programmers at the University of California hacked mightily on the source code AT&T had released, leading to many a master thesis. The Berkeley Standard Distribution (BSD) became a second major variant of ""UNIX."" It was widely deployed in both university and corporate computing environments starting with the release of BSD 4.2 in 1984. Some of its features were incorporated into SVR4.As the 1990s opened, AT&T\'s source code licensing had created a flourishing market for hundreds of UNIX variants by different manufacturers. AT&T sold its UNIX business to Novell in 1993, and Novell sold it to the Santa Cruz Operation two years later. In the meantime, the UNIX trademark had been passed to the X/Open consortium, which eventually merged to form The Open Group.1While the stewardship of UNIX was passing from entity to entity, several long-running development efforts started bearing fruit. Traditionally, in order to get a BSD system working, you needed a source code license from AT&T. But by the early 1990s, Berkeley hackers had done so much work on BSD that most of the original AT&T source code was long gone. A succession of programmers, starting with William and Lynne Jolitz, started work on the Net distribution of BSD, leading to the release of 386BSD version 0.1 on Bastille Day, 1992. This original ""free source"" BSD was spun out into three major distributions, each of which has a dedicated following: NetBSD, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD, all of which are based on BSD 4.4.2BSD wasn\'t the first attempt at a ""free"" UNIX. In 1984, programmer Richard Stallman started work on a free UNIX clone known as GNU (GNU\'s Not UNIX). By the early 1990s, the GNU Project had achieved several programming milestones, including the release of the GNU C library and the Bourne Again SHell (bash). The whole system was basically finished, except for one critical element: a working kernel.Enter Linus Torvalds, a student at the University of Helsinki in Finland. Linus looked at a small UNIX system called Minix and decided he could do better. In the fall of 1991, he released the source code for a freeware kernel called ""Linux"" -- a combination of his first name and Minux, pronounced lynn-nucks.3 By 1994, Linus and a far-flung team of kernel hackers were able to release version 1.0 of Linux. Linus and friends had a free kernel; Stallman and friends had the rest of a free UNIX clone system: People could then put the Linux kernel together with GNU to make a complete free system. This system is known as ""Linux,"" though Stallman prefers the appellation ""GNU/Linux system.""4 There are several distinct GNU/Linux distributions: some are available with commercial support from companies like Red Hat, Caldera Systems, and S.U.S.E.; others, like Debian GNU/Linux, are more closely aligned with the original free software concept.The spread of Linux, now up to kernel version 2.2, has been a startling phenomenon. Linux runs on several different chip architectures and has been adopted or supported to varying extents by several old-line UNIX vendors like Hewlett-Packard, Silicon Graphics, and Sun Microsystems, by PC vendors like Compaq and Dell, and by major software vendors like Oracle and IBM. Perhaps the most delicious irony has been the response of Microsoft, which acknowledges the competitive threat of ubiquitous free software but seems unwilling or unable to respond with open-source software of its own.5Microsoft has, however, struck blows with Windows NT (Windows 2000). During the late 1990s, vendor after vendor has abandoned the UNIX server platform in favor of Windows NT or wavered in their support. Silicon Graphics Inc., for example, has decided that Intel hardware and NT is the graphics platform of the future.The phenomenon of old-line UNIX vendors jumping ship and the concurrent rush to Linux by vendors large and small brings us back to the question at the top of this section: What is UNIX? While one can abide by the legal definition as embodied in the trademark, I believe that this does a major disservice to the industry. As the base software of the Internet, UNIX technology is one the significant achievements of 20th century civilization. To restrict it to a narrow legal or technical definition -- as formulated by some of the vendors now abandoning it -- is to deny its ongoing relevance and importance, which is most evident in the amazing popularity and strength of UNIX-like clones such as GNU/Linux and BSD.For the purposes of the book, I define UNIX asA set of enabling technologies first developed at AT&T that have been incorporated into several legally distinct but closely related operating systems, each of which can be considered to be a ""UNIX system."" If it looks like UNIX, operates like UNIX, runs common UNIX utilities and programs, and is developed with UNIX as a model, it\'s UNIX.1.This version of events is captured by the History & Timeline that can be found athttp://www.UNIX-systems.org/what_is_unix/2.

There are several distinct GNU/Linux distributions: some are available with commercial support from companies like Red Hat, Caldera Systems, and S.U.S.E.; others, like Debian GNU/Linux, are more closely aligned with the original free software concept.\n\nThe spread of Linux, now up to kernel version 2.2, has been a startling phenomenon. Linux runs on several different chip architectures and has been adopted or supported to varying extents by several old-line UNIX vendors like Hewlett-Packard, Silicon Graphics, and Sun Microsystems, by PC vendors like Compaq and Dell, and by major software vendors like Oracle and IBM. Perhaps the most delicious irony has been the response of Microsoft, which acknowledges the competitive threat of ubiquitous free software but seems unwilling or unable to respond with open-source software of its own.\n\nMicrosoft has, however, struck blows with Windows NT (Windows 2000). During the late 1990s, vendor after vendor has abandoned the UNIX server platform in favor of Windows NT or wavered in their support. Silicon Graphics Inc., for example, has decided that Intel hardware and NT is the graphics platform of the future.\n\nThe phenomenon of old-line UNIX vendors jumping ship and the concurrent rush to Linux by vendors large and small brings us back to the question at the top of this section: What is UNIX? While one can abide by the legal definition as embodied in the trademark, I believe that this does a major disservice to the industry. As the base software of the Internet, UNIX technology is one the significant achievements of 20th century civilization. To restrict it to a narrow legal or technical definition -- as formulated by some of the vendors now abandoning it -- is to deny its ongoing relevance and importance, which is most evident in the amazing popularity and strength of UNIX-like clones such as GNU/Linux and BSD.\n\nFor the purposes of the book, I define UNIX as a set of enabling technologies first developed at AT&T that have been incorporated into several legally distinct but closely related operating systems, each of which can be considered to be a ""UNIX system."" If it looks like UNIX, operates like UNIX, runs common UNIX utilities and programs, and is developed with UNIX as a model, it\'s UNIX.\n\n1.This version of events is captured by the History & Timeline that can be found at http://www.UNIX-systems.org/what_is_unix/\n2.

 {'raw_text': 'Open source has taken a prominent role in the IT industry today. It is everywhere from the smallest embedded systems to the biggest supercomputer, from the phone in your pocket to the software running the websites and infrastructure of the companies we engage with every day. Let\'s explore how we got here and discuss key moments from the past 40 years that have paved a path to the current day.1. RMS and the printerIn the late 1970s, Richard M. Stallman (RMS) was a staff programmer at MIT. His department, like those at many universities at the time, shared a PDP-10 computer and a single printer. One problem they encountered was that paper would regularly jam in the printer, causing a string of print jobs to pile up in a queue until someone fixed the jam. To get around this problem, the MIT staff came up with a nice social hack: They wrote code for the printer driver so that when it jammed, a message would be sent to everyone who was currently waiting for a print job: ""The printer is jammed, please fix it."" This way, it was never stuck for long.In 1980, the lab accepted a donation of a brand-new laser printer. When Stallman asked for the source code for the printer driver, however, so he could reimplement the social hack to have the system notify users on a paper jam, he was told that this was proprietary information. He heard of a researcher in a different university who had the source code for a research project, and when the opportunity arose, he asked this colleague to share it—and was shocked when they refused. They had signed an NDA, which Stallman took as a betrayal of the hacker culture.The late \'70s and early \'80s represented an era where software, which had traditionally been given away with the hardware in source code form, was seen to be valuable. Increasingly, MIT researchers were starting software companies, and selling licenses to the software was key to their business models. NDAs and proprietary software licenses became the norms, and the best programmers were hired from universities like MIT to work on private development projects where they could no longer share or collaborate.As a reaction to this, Stallman resolved that he would create a complete operating system that would not deprive users of the freedom to understand how it worked, and would allow them to make changes if they wished. It was the birth of the free software movement.2. Creation of GNU and the advent of free softwareBy late 1983, Stallman was ready to announce his project and recruit supporters and helpers. In September 1983, he announced the creation of the GNU project (GNU stands for GNU\'s Not Unix—a recursive acronym). The goal of the project was to clone the Unix operating system to create a system that would give complete freedom to users.In January 1984, he started working full-time on the project, first creating a compiler system (GCC) and various operating system utilities. Early in 1985, he published ""The GNU Manifesto,"" which was a call to arms for programmers to join the effort, and launched the Free Software Foundation in order to accept donations to support the work. This document is the founding charter of the free software movement.3. The writing of the GPLUntil 1989, software written and released by the Free Software Foundation and RMS did not have a single license. Emacs was released under the Emacs license, GCC was released under the GCC license, and so on; however, after a company called Unipress forced Stallman to stop distributing copies of an Emacs implementation they had acquired from James Gosling (of Java fame), he felt that a license to secure user freedoms was important.The first version of the GNU General Public License was released in 1989, and it encapsulated the values of copyleft (a play on words—what is the opposite of copyright?): You may use, copy, distribute, and modify the software covered by the license, but if you make changes, you must share the modified source code alongside the modified binaries. This simple requirement to share modified software, in combination with the advent of the internet in the 1990s, is what enabled the decentralized, collaborative development model of the free software movement to flourish.4. ""The Cathedral and the Bazaar""By the mid-1990s, Linux was starting to take off, and free software had become more mainstream—or perhaps ""less fringe"" would be more accurate. The Linux kernel was being developed in a way that was completely different to anything people had been seen before, and was very successful doing it. Out of the chaos of the kernel community came order, and a fast-moving project.In 1997, Eric S. Raymond published the seminal essay, ""The Cathedral and the Bazaar,"" comparing and contrasting the development methodologies and social structure of GCC and the Linux kernel and talking about his own experiences with a ""bazaar"" development model with the Fetchmail project. Many of the principles that Raymond describes in this essay will later become central to agile development and the DevOps movement—""release early, release often,"" refactoring of code, and treating users as co-developers are all fundamental to modern software development.This essay has been credited with bringing free software to a broader audience, and with convincing executives at software companies at the time that releasing their software under a free software license was the right thing to do. Raymond went on to be instrumental in the coining of the term ""open source"" and the creation of the Open Source Institute.""The Cathedral and the Bazaar"" was credited as a key document in the 1998 release of the source code for the Netscape web browser Mozilla. At the time, this was the first major release of an existing, widely used piece of desktop software as free software, which brought it further into the public eye.5. Open sourceAs far back as 1985, the ambiguous nature of the word ""free"", used to describe software freedom, was identified as problematic by RMS himself. In the GNU Manifesto, he identified ""give away"" and ""for free"" as terms that confused zero price and user freedom. ""Free as in freedom,"" ""Speech not beer,"" and similar mantras were common when free software hit a mainstream audience in the late 1990s, but a number of prominent community figures argued that a term was needed that made the concept more accessible to the general public.After Netscape released the source code for Mozilla in 1998 (see #4), a group of people, including Eric Raymond, Bruce Perens, Michael Tiemann, Jon ""Maddog"" Hall, and many of the leading lights of the free software world, gathered in Palo Alto to discuss an alternative term. The term ""open source"" was coined by Christine Peterson to describe free software, and the Open Source Institute was later founded by Bruce Perens and Eric Raymond. The fundamental difference with proprietary software, they argued, was the availability of the source code, and so this was what should be put forward first in the branding.Later that year, at a summit organized by Tim O\'Reilly, an extended group of some of the most influential people in the free software world at the time gathered to debate various new brands for free software. In the end, ""open source"" edged out ""sourceware,"" and open source began to be adopted by many projects in the community.There was some disagreement, however. Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation continued to champion the term ""free software,"" because to them, the fundamental difference with proprietary software was user freedom, and the availability of source code was just a means to that end. Stallman argued that removing the focus on freedom would lead to a future where source code would be available, but the user of the software would not be able to avail of the freedom to modify the software. With the advent of web-deployed software-as-a-service and open source firmware embedded in devices, the battle continues to be waged today.6. Corporate investment in open source—VA Linux, Red Hat, IBMIn the late 1990s, a series of high-profile events led to a huge increase in the professionalization of free and open source software. Among these, the highest-profile events were the IPOs of VA Linux and Red Hat in 1999. Both companies had massive gains in share price on their opening days as publicly traded companies, proving that open source was now going commercial and mainstream.Also in 1999, IBM announced that they were supporting Linux by investing $1 billion in its development, making is less risky to traditional enterprise users. The following year, Sun Microsystems released the source code to its cross-platform office suite, StarOffice, and created the OpenOffice.org project.The combined effect of massive Silicon Valley funding of open source projects, the attention of Wall Street for young companies built around open source software, and the market credibility that tech giants like IBM and Sun Microsystems brought had combined to create the massive adoption of open source, and the embrace of the open development model that helped it thrive have led to the dominance of Linux and open source in the tech industry today.Which pivotal moments would you add to the list?

Corporate investment in open source\n\n'}]",4,"['**About the Author**\n\n**Dr. Elena Marwick** is a renowned systems historian and software infrastructure expert, celebrated for her groundbreaking work chronicling the evolution of operating systems and their cultural impact on modern computing. With a Ph.D. in Computer Science from MIT and over two decades of experience in both academia and industry, Dr. Marwick has become a leading voice in demystifying the complex lineage of Unix and Linux for a new generation of developers. Her best-selling book, *Roots of the Kernel: A Cultural History of Unix and Linux*, is widely regarded as a definitive guide to the philosophical and technical foundations of open-source systems. As a former research fellow at the Open Source Initiative and a frequent keynote speaker at global tech conferences, Dr. Marwick continues to bridge the gap between historical insight and practical application, inspiring developers to understand not just how their tools work—but why they matter.\n\n\n  If you are a software developer in your 20s or 30s, you\'ve grown up in a world dominated by Linux. It has been a significant player in the data center for decades, and while it\'s hard to find definitive operating system market share reports, Linux\'s share of data center operating systems could be as high as 70%, with Windows variants carrying nearly all the remaining percentage. Developers using any major public cloud can expect the target system will run Linux. Evidence that Linux is everywhere has grown in recent years when you add in Android and Linux-based embedded systems in smartphones, TVs, automobiles, and many other devices.\n\nEven so, most software developers, even those who have grown up during this venerable ""Linux revolution"" have at least heard of Unix. It sounds similar to Linux, and you\'ve probably heard people use these terms interchangeably. Or maybe you\'ve heard Linux called a ""Unix-like"" operating system.\n\nSo, what is this Unix? The caricatures speak of wizard-like ""graybeards"" sitting behind glowing green screens, writing C code and shell scripts, powered by old-fashioned, drip-brewed coffee. But Unix has a much richer history beyond those bearded C programmers from the 1970s. While articles detailing the history of Unix and ""Unix vs. Linux"" comparisons abound, this article will offer a high-level background and a list of major differences between these complementary worlds.\n\nUnix\'s beginnings\nThe history of Unix begins at AT&T Bell Labs in the late 1960s with a small team of programmers looking to write a multi-tasking, multi-user operating system for the PDP-7. Two of the most notable members of this team at the Bell Labs research facility were Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie. While many of Unix\'s concepts were derivative of its predecessor (Multics), the Unix team\'s decision early in the 1970s to rewrite this small operating system in the C language is what separated Unix from all others. At the time, operating systems were rarely, if ever, portable. Instead, by nature of their design and low-level source language, operating systems were tightly linked to the hardware platform for which they had been authored. By refactoring Unix on the C programming language, Unix could now be ported to many hardware architectures.\n\nIn addition to this new portability, which allowed Unix to quickly expand beyond Bell Labs to other research, academic, and even commercial uses, several key of the operating system\'s design tenets were attractive to users and programmers. For one, Ken Thompson\'s Unix philosophy became a powerful model of modular software design and computing. The Unix philosophy recommended utilizing small, purpose-built programs in combination to do complex overall tasks. Since Unix was designed around files and pipes, this model of ""piping"" inputs and outputs of programs together into a linear set of operations on the input is still in vogue today. In fact, the current cloud serverless computing model owes much of its heritage to the Unix philosophy.\n\nRapid growth and competition\nThrough the late 1970s and 80s, Unix became the root of a family tree that expanded across research, academia, and a growing commercial Unix operating system business. Unix was not open source software, and the Unix source code was licensable via agreements with its owner, AT&T. The first known software license was sold to the University of Illinois in 1975.\n\nUnix grew quickly in academia, with Berkeley becoming a significant center of activity, given Ken Thompson\'s sabbatical there in the \'70s. With all the activity around Unix at Berkeley, a new delivery of Unix software was born: the Berkeley Software Distribution, or BSD. Initially, BSD was not an alternative to AT&T\'s Unix, but an add-on with additional software and capabilities. By the time 2BSD (the Second Berkeley Software Distribution) arrived in 1979, Bill Joy, a Berkeley grad student, had added now-famous programs such asvi and the C shell (/bin/csh).\n\nIn addition to BSD, which became one of the most popular branches of the Unix family, Unix\'s commercial offerings exploded through the 1980s and into the \'90s with names like HP-UX, IBM\'s AIX, Sun\'s Solaris, Sequent, and Xenix. As the branches grew from the original root, the ""Unix wars"" began, and standardization became a new focus for the community. The POSIX standard was born in 1988, as well as other standardization follow-ons via The Open Group into the 1990s.\n\nAround this time AT&T and Sun released System V Release 4 (SVR4), which was adopted by many commercial vendors. Separately, the BSD family of operating systems had grown over the years, leading to some open source variations that were released under the now-familiar BSD license. This included FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD, each with a slightly different target market in the Unix server industry. These Unix variants continue to have some usage today, although many have seen their server market share dwindle into the single digits (or lower). BSD may have the largest install base of any modern Unix system today. Also, every Apple Mac hardware unit shipped in recent history can be claimed by BSD, as its OS X (now macOS) operating system is a BSD-derivative.\n\nWhile the full history of Unix and its academic and commercial variants could take many more pages, for the sake of our article focus, let\'s move on to the rise of Linux.\nEnter Linux\nWhat we call the Linux operating system today is really the combination of two efforts from the early 1990s. Richard Stallman was looking to create a truly free and open source alternative to the proprietary Unix system. He was working on the utilities and programs under the name GNU, a recursive acronym meaning ""GNU\'s not Unix!"" Although there was a kernel project underway, it turned out to be difficult going, and without a kernel, the free and open source operating system dream could not be realized. It was Linus Torvald\'s work—producing a working and viable kernel that he called Linux—that brought the complete operating system to life. Given that Linus was using several GNU tools (e.g., the GNU Compiler Collection, or GCC), the marriage of the GNU tools and the Linux kernel was a perfect match.\n\nLinux distributions came to life with the components of GNU, the Linux kernel, MIT\'s X-Windows GUI, and other BSD components that could be used under the open source BSD license. The early popularity of distributions like Slackware and then Red Hat gave the ""common PC user"" of the 1990s access to the Linux operating system and, with it, many of the proprietary Unix system capabilities and utilities they used in their work or academic lives.\n\nBecause of the free and open source standing of all the Linux components, anyone could create a Linux distribution with a bit of effort, and soon the total number of distros reached into the hundreds. Of course, many developers utilize Linux either via cloud providers or by using popular free distributions like Fedora, Canonical\'s Ubuntu, Debian, Arch Linux, Gentoo, and many other variants. Commercial Linux offerings, which provide support on top of the free and open source components, became viable as many enterprises, including IBM, migrated from proprietary Unix to offering middleware and software solutions atop Linux. Red Hat built a model of commercial support around Red Hat Enterprise Linux, as did German provider SUSE with SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES).\n\nComparing Unix and Linux\nSo far, we\'ve looked at the history of Unix and the rise of Linux and the GNU/Free Software Foundation underpinnings of a free and open source alternative to Unix. Let\'s examine the differences between these two operating systems that share much of the same heritage and many of the same goals.\n\nFrom a user experience perspective, not very much is different! Much of the attraction of Linux was the operating system\'s availability across many hardware architectures (including the modern PC) and ability to use tools familiar to Unix system administrators and users.\n\n ', 'Linux\nLinux, computer operating system created in the early 1990s by Finnish software engineer Linus Torvalds and the Free Software Foundation (FSF).\nWhile still a student at the University of Helsinki, Torvalds started developing Linux to create a system similar to MINIX, a UNIX operating system. In 1991 he released version 0.02; Version 1.0 of the Linux kernel, the core of the operating system, was released in 1994. About the same time, American software developer Richard Stallman and the FSF made efforts to create an open-source UNIX-like operating system called GNU. In contrast to Torvalds, Stallman and the FSF started by creating utilities for the operating system first. These utilities were then added to the Linux kernel to create a complete system called GNU/Linux, or, less precisely, just Linux.\n\nLinux grew throughout the 1990s because of the efforts of hobbyist developers. Although Linux is not as user-friendly as the popular Microsoft Windows and Mac OS operating systems, it is an efficient and reliable system that rarely crashes. Combined with its open-source nature, Linux has become a popular choice for servers and other computing systems.\n\nMarkdown formatted text:\n# Linux\nLinux, computer operating system created in the early 1990s by Finnish software engineer Linus Torvalds and the Free Software Foundation (FSF).\nWhile still a student at the University of Helsinki, Torvalds started developing Linux to create a system similar to MINIX, a UNIX operating system.

The operating system was soon christened Unix, a pun on an earlier operating system project called MULTICS. In 1972-1973 the system was rewritten in the programming language C, an unusual step that was visionary: due to this decision, Unix was the first widely-used operating system that could switch from and outlive its original hardware. Other innovations were added to Unix as well, in part due to synergies between Bell Labs and the academic community. In 1979, the ""seventh edition"" (V7) version of Unix was released, the grandfather of all extant Unix systems.\n\nAfter this point, the history of Unix becomes somewhat convoluted. The academic community, led by Berkeley, developed a variant called the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), while AT&T continued developing Unix under the names ""System III"" and later ""System V"". In the late 1980\'s through early 1990\'s the ""wars"" between these two major strains raged. After many years each variant adopted many of the key features of the other. Commercially, System V won the ""standards wars"" (getting most of its interfaces into the formal standards), and most hardware vendors switched to AT&T\'s System V. However, System V ended up incorporating many BSD innovations, so the resulting system was more a merger of the two branches. The BSD branch did not die, but instead became widely used for research, for PC hardware, and for single-purpose servers (e.g., many web sites use a BSD derivative).\n\nThe result was many different versions of Unix, all based on the original seventh edition. Most versions of Unix were proprietary and maintained by their respective hardware vendor, for example, Sun Solaris is a variant of System V. Three versions of the BSD branch of Unix ended up as open source: FreeBSD (concentrating on ease-of-installation for PC-type hardware), NetBSD (concentrating on many different CPU architectures), and a variant of NetBSD, OpenBSD (concentrating on security).\n\nIn 1984 Richard Stallman\'s Free Software Foundation (FSF) began the GNU project, a project to create a free version of the Unix operating system. By free, Stallman meant software that could be freely used, read, modified, and redistributed. The FSF successfully built a vast number of useful components, including a C compiler (gcc), an impressive text editor (emacs), and a host of fundamental tools. However, in the 1990\'s the FSF was having trouble developing the operating system kernel [FSF 1998]; without a kernel their dream of a completely free operating system would not be realized.\n\nIn 1991 Linus Torvalds began developing an operating system kernel, which he named ""Linux"" [Torvalds 1999]. This kernel could be combined with the FSF material and other components (in particular some of the BSD components and MIT\'s X-windows software) to produce a freely-modifiable and very useful operating system. This book will term the kernel itself the ""Linux kernel"" and an entire combination as ""Linux"". Note that many use the term ""GNU/Linux"" instead for this combination.\n\nIn the Linux community, different organizations have combined the available components differently. Each combination is called a ""distribution"", and the organizations that develop distributions are called ""distributors"". Common distributions include Red Hat, Mandrake, SuSE, Caldera, Corel, and Debian. There are differences between the various distributions, but all distributions are based on the same foundation: the Linux kernel and the GNU glibc libraries. Since both are covered by ""copyleft"" style licenses, changes to these foundations generally must be made available to all, a unifying force between the Linux distributions at their foundation that does not exist between the BSD and AT&T-derived Unix systems. This book is not specific to any Linux distribution; when it discusses Linux it presumes Linux kernel version 2.2 or greater and the C library glibc 2.1 or greater, valid assumptions for essentially all current major Linux distributions.\n\nIncreased interest in software that is freely shared has made it increasingly necessary to define and explain it. A widely used term is ""open source software"", which is further defined in [OSI 1999]. Eric Raymond [1997, 1998] wrote several seminal articles examining its various development processes. Another widely-used term is ""free software"", where the ""free"" is short for ""freedom"": the usual explanation is ""free speech, not free beer."" Neither phrase is perfect. The term ""free software"" is often confused with programs whose executables are given away at no charge, but whose source code cannot be viewed, modified, or redistributed. Conversely, the term ""open source"" is sometime (ab)used to mean software whose source code is visible, but for which there are limitations on use, modification, or redistribution. This book uses the term ""open source"" for its usual meaning, that is, software which has its source code freely available for use, viewing, modification, and redistribution; a more detailed definition is contained in the Open Source Definition. In some cases, a difference in motive is suggested; those preferring the term ""free software"" wish to strongly emphasize the need for freedom, while those using the term may have other motives (e.g., higher reliability) or simply wish to appear less strident. For information on this definition of free software, and the motivations behind it, can be found at http://www.fsf.org.\n\nThose interested in reading advocacy pieces for open source software and free software should see http://www.opensource.org and http://www.fsf.org. There are other documents which examine such software, for example, Miller [1995] found that the open source software were noticeably more reliable than proprietary software (using their measurement technique, which measured resistance to crashing due to random input).\n\nThis book uses the term ""Unix-like"" to describe systems intentionally like Unix. In particular, the term ""Unix-like"" includes all major Unix variants and Linux distributions. Note that many people simply use the term ""Unix"" to describe these systems instead. Originally, the term ""Unix"" meant a particular product developed by AT&T. Today, the Open Group owns the Unix trademark, and it defines Unix as ""the worldwide Single UNIX Specification"".\n\nLinux is not derived from Unix source code, but its interfaces are intentionally like Unix. Therefore, Unix lessons learned generally apply to both, including information on security. Most of the information in this book applies to any Unix-like system. Linux-specific information has been intentionally added to enable those using Linux to take advantage of Linux\'s capabilities.\n\nUnix-like systems share a number of security mechanisms, though there are subtle differences and not all systems have all mechanisms available. All include user and group ids (uids and gids) for each process and a filesystem with read, write, and execute permissions (for user, group, and other). See Thompson [1974] and Bach [1986] for general information on Unix systems, including their basic security mechanisms. Chapter 3 summarizes key security features of Unix and Linux.\n\n', 'A Quick History of UNIX\nIn order to define UNIX, it helps to look at its history. In 1969, Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie and others started work on what was to become UNIX on a ""little-used PDP-7 in a corner"" at AT&T Bell Labs. For ten years, the development of UNIX proceeded at AT&T in numbered versions. V4 (1974) was re-written in C -- a major milestone for the operating system\'s portability among different systems. V6 (1975) was the first to become available outside Bell Labs -- it became the basis of the first version of UNIX developed at the University of California Berkeley.\n\nBell Labs continued work on UNIX into the 1980s, culminating in the release of System V (as in ""five,"" not the letter) in 1983 and System V, Release 4 (abbreviated SVR4) in 1989. Meanwhile, programmers at the University of California hacked mightily on the source code AT&T had released, leading to many a master thesis. The Berkeley Standard Distribution (BSD) became a second major variant of ""UNIX."" It was widely deployed in both university and corporate computing environments starting with the release of BSD 4.2 in 1984. Some of its features were incorporated into SVR4.\n\nAs the 1990s opened, AT&T\'s source code licensing had created a flourishing market for hundreds of UNIX variants by different manufacturers. AT&T sold its UNIX business to Novell in 1993, and Novell sold it to the Santa Cruz Operation two years later. In the meantime, the UNIX trademark had been passed to the X/Open consortium, which eventually merged to form The Open Group.\n\nWhile the stewardship of UNIX was passing from entity to entity, several long-running development efforts started bearing fruit. Traditionally, in order to get a BSD system working, you needed a source code license from AT&T. But by the early 1990s, Berkeley hackers had done so much work on BSD that most of the original AT&T source code was long gone. A succession of programmers, starting with William and Lynne Jolitz, started work on the Net distribution of BSD, leading to the release of 386BSD version 0.1 on Bastille Day, 1992. This original ""free source"" BSD was spun out into three major distributions, each of which has a dedicated following: NetBSD, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD, all of which are based on BSD 4.4.2.\n\nBSD wasn\'t the first attempt at a ""free"" UNIX. In 1984, programmer Richard Stallman started work on a free UNIX clone known as GNU (GNU\'s Not UNIX). By the early 1990s, the GNU Project had achieved several programming milestones, including the release of the GNU C library and the Bourne Again SHell (bash). The whole system was basically finished, except for one critical element: a working kernel.\n\nEnter Linus Torvalds, a student at the University of Helsinki in Finland. Linus looked at a small UNIX system called Minix and decided he could do better. In the fall of 1991, he released the source code for a freeware kernel called ""Linux"" -- a combination of his first name and Minux, pronounced lynn-nucks. By 1994, Linus and a far-flung team of kernel hackers were able to release version 1.0 of Linux. Linus and friends had a free kernel; Stallman and friends had the rest of a free UNIX clone system: People could then put the Linux kernel together with GNU to make a complete free system. This system is known as ""Linux,"" though Stallman prefers the appellation ""GNU/Linux system."" There are several distinct GNU/Linux distributions: some are available with commercial support from companies like Red Hat, Caldera Systems, and S.U.S.E.; others, like Debian GNU/Linux, are more closely aligned with the original free software concept.\n\nThe spread of Linux, now up to kernel version 2.2, has been a startling phenomenon. Linux runs on several different chip architectures and has been adopted or supported to varying extents by several old-line UNIX vendors like Hewlett-Packard, Silicon Graphics, and Sun Microsystems, by PC vendors like Compaq and Dell, and by major software vendors like Oracle and IBM. Perhaps the most delicious irony has been the response of Microsoft, which acknowledges the competitive threat of ubiquitous free software but seems unwilling or unable to respond with open-source software of its own.\n\nMicrosoft has, however, struck blows with Windows NT (Windows 2000). During the late 1990s, vendor after vendor has abandoned the UNIX server platform in favor of Windows NT or wavered in their support. Silicon Graphics Inc., for example, has decided that Intel hardware and NT is the graphics platform of the future.\n\nThe phenomenon of old-line UNIX vendors jumping ship and the concurrent rush to Linux by vendors large and small brings us back to the question at the top of this section: What is UNIX? While one can abide by the legal definition as embodied in the trademark, I believe that this does a major disservice to the industry. As the base software of the Internet, UNIX technology is one the significant achievements of 20th century civilization. To restrict it to a narrow legal or technical definition -- as formulated by some of the vendors now abandoning it -- is to deny its ongoing relevance and importance, which is most evident in the amazing popularity and strength of UNIX-like clones such as GNU/Linux and BSD.\n\nFor the purposes of the book, I define UNIX as a set of enabling technologies first developed at AT&T that have been incorporated into several legally distinct but closely related operating systems, each of which can be considered to be a ""UNIX system."" If it looks like UNIX, operates like UNIX, runs common UNIX utilities and programs, and is developed with UNIX as a model, it\'s UNIX.\n\n1.This version of events is captured by the History & Timeline that can be found at http://www.UNIX-systems.org/what_is_unix/\n2.

It is everywhere from the smallest embedded systems to the biggest supercomputer, from the phone in your pocket to the software running the websites and infrastructure of the companies we engage with every day. Let\'s explore how we got here and discuss key moments from the past 40 years that have paved a path to the current day.\n\n1. RMS and the printer\nIn the late 1970s, Richard M. Stallman (RMS) was a staff programmer at MIT. His department, like those at many universities at the time, shared a PDP-10 computer and a single printer. One problem they encountered was that paper would regularly jam in the printer, causing a string of print jobs to pile up in a queue until someone fixed the jam. To get around this problem, the MIT staff came up with a nice social hack: They wrote code for the printer driver so that when it jammed, a message would be sent to everyone who was currently waiting for a print job: ""The printer is jammed, please fix it."" This way, it was never stuck for long.\n\nIn 1980, the lab accepted a donation of a brand-new laser printer. When Stallman asked for the source code for the printer driver, however, so he could reimplement the social hack to have the system notify users on a paper jam, he was told that this was proprietary information. He heard of a researcher in a different university who had the source code for a research project, and when the opportunity arose, he asked this colleague to share it—and was shocked when they refused. They had signed an NDA, which Stallman took as a betrayal of the hacker culture.\n\nThe late \'70s and early \'80s represented an era where software, which had traditionally been given away with the hardware in source code form, was seen to be valuable. Increasingly, MIT researchers were starting software companies, and selling licenses to the software was key to their business models. NDAs and proprietary software licenses became the norms, and the best programmers were hired from universities like MIT to work on private development projects where they could no longer share or collaborate.\n\nAs a reaction to this, Stallman resolved that he would create a complete operating system that would not deprive users of the freedom to understand how it worked, and would allow them to make changes if they wished. It was the birth of the free software movement.\n\n2. Creation of GNU and the advent of free software\nBy late 1983, Stallman was ready to announce his project and recruit supporters and helpers. In September 1983, he announced the creation of the GNU project (GNU stands for GNU\'s Not Unix—a recursive acronym). The goal of the project was to clone the Unix operating system to create a system that would give complete freedom to users.\n\nIn January 1984, he started working full-time on the project, first creating a compiler system (GCC) and various operating system utilities. Early in 1985, he published ""The GNU Manifesto,"" which was a call to arms for programmers to join the effort, and launched the Free Software Foundation in order to accept donations to support the work. This document is the founding charter of the free software movement.\n\n3. The writing of the GPL\nUntil 1989, software written and released by the Free Software Foundation and RMS did not have a single license. Emacs was released under the Emacs license, GCC was released under the GCC license, and so on; however, after a company called Unipress forced Stallman to stop distributing copies of an Emacs implementation they had acquired from James Gosling (of Java fame), he felt that a license to secure user freedoms was important.\n\nThe first version of the GNU General Public License was released in 1989, and it encapsulated the values of copyleft (a play on words—what is the opposite of copyright?): You may use, copy, distribute, and modify the software covered by the license, but if you make changes, you must share the modified source code alongside the modified binaries. This simple requirement to share modified software, in combination with the advent of the internet in the 1990s, is what enabled the decentralized, collaborative development model of the free software movement to flourish.\n\n4. ""The Cathedral and the Bazaar""\nBy the mid-1990s, Linux was starting to take off, and free software had become more mainstream—or perhaps ""less fringe"" would be more accurate. The Linux kernel was being developed in a way that was completely different to anything people had been seen before, and was very successful doing it. Out of the chaos of the kernel community came order, and a fast-moving project.\n\nIn 1997, Eric S. Raymond published the seminal essay, ""The Cathedral and the Bazaar,"" comparing and contrasting the development methodologies and social structure of GCC and the Linux kernel and talking about his own experiences with a ""bazaar"" development model with the Fetchmail project. Many of the principles that Raymond describes in this essay will later become central to agile development and the DevOps movement—""release early, release often,"" refactoring of code, and treating users as co-developers are all fundamental to modern software development.\n\nThis essay has been credited with bringing free software to a broader audience, and with convincing executives at software companies at the time that releasing their software under a free software license was the right thing to do. Raymond went on to be instrumental in the coining of the term ""open source"" and the creation of the Open Source Institute.\n\n""The Cathedral and the Bazaar"" was credited as a key document in the 1998 release of the source code for the Netscape web browser Mozilla. At the time, this was the first major release of an existing, widely used piece of desktop software as free software, which brought it further into the public eye.\n\n5. Open source\nAs far back as 1985, the ambiguous nature of the word ""free"", used to describe software freedom, was identified as problematic by RMS himself. In the GNU Manifesto, he identified ""give away"" and ""for free"" as terms that confused zero price and user freedom. ""Free as in freedom,"" ""Speech not beer,"" and similar mantras were common when free software hit a mainstream audience in the late 1990s, but a number of prominent community figures argued that a term was needed that made the concept more accessible to the general public.\n\nAfter Netscape released the source code for Mozilla in 1998 (see #4), a group of people, including Eric Raymond, Bruce Perens, Michael Tiemann, Jon ""Maddog"" Hall, and many of the leading lights of the free software world, gathered in Palo Alto to discuss an alternative term. The term ""open source"" was coined by Christine Peterson to describe free software, and the Open Source Institute was later founded by Bruce Perens and Eric Raymond. The fundamental difference with proprietary software, they argued, was the availability of the source code, and so this was what should be put forward first in the branding.\n\nLater that year, at a summit organized by Tim O\'Reilly, an extended group of some of the most influential people in the free software world at the time gathered to debate various new brands for free software. In the end, ""open source"" edged out ""sourceware,"" and open source began to be adopted by many projects in the community.\n\nThere was some disagreement, however. Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation continued to champion the term ""free software,"" because to them, the fundamental difference with proprietary software was user freedom, and the availability of source code was just a means to that end. Stallman argued that removing the focus on freedom would lead to a future where source code would be available, but the user of the software would not be able to avail of the freedom to modify the software. With the advent of web-deployed software-as-a-service and open source firmware embedded in devices, the battle continues to be waged today.\n\n6.

  If you are a software developer in your 20s or 30s, you've grown up in a world dominated by Linux. It has been a significant player in the data center for decades, and while it's hard to find definitive operating system market share reports, Linux's share of data center operating systems could be as high as 70%, with Windows variants carrying nearly all the remaining percentage. Developers using any major public cloud can expect the target system will run Linux. Evidence that Linux is everywhere has grown in recent years when you add in Android and Linux-based embedded systems in smartphones, TVs, automobiles, and many other devices.

Even so, most software developers, even those who have grown up during this venerable ""Linux revolution"" have at least heard of Unix. It sounds similar to Linux, and you've probably heard people use these terms interchangeably. Or maybe you've heard Linux called a ""Unix-like"" operating system.

So, what is this Unix? The caricatures speak of wizard-like ""graybeards"" sitting behind glowing green screens, writing C code and shell scripts, powered by old-fashioned, drip-brewed coffee. But Unix has a much richer history beyond those bearded C programmers from the 1970s. While articles detailing the history of Unix and ""Unix vs. Linux"" comparisons abound, this article will offer a high-level background and a list of major differences between these complementary worlds.

Unix's beginnings
The history of Unix begins at AT&T Bell Labs in the late 1960s with a small team of programmers looking to write a multi-tasking, multi-user operating system for the PDP-7. Two of the most notable members of this team at the Bell Labs research facility were Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie. While many of Unix's concepts were derivative of its predecessor (Multics), the Unix team's decision early in the 1970s to rewrite this small operating system in the C language is what separated Unix from all others. At the time, operating systems were rarely, if ever, portable. Instead, by nature of their design and low-level source language, operating systems were tightly linked to the hardware platform for which they had been authored. By refactoring Unix on the C programming language, Unix could now be ported to many hardware architectures.

In addition to this new portability, which allowed Unix to quickly expand beyond Bell Labs to other research, academic, and even commercial uses, several key of the operating system's design tenets were attractive to users and programmers. For one, Ken Thompson's Unix philosophy became a powerful model of modular software design and computing. The Unix philosophy recommended utilizing small, purpose-built programs in combination to do complex overall tasks. Since Unix was designed around files and pipes, this model of ""piping"" inputs and outputs of programs together into a linear set of operations on the input is still in vogue today. In fact, the current cloud serverless computing model owes much of its heritage to the Unix philosophy.

Rapid growth and competition
Through the late 1970s and 80s, Unix became the root of a family tree that expanded across research, academia, and a growing commercial Unix operating system business. Unix was not open source software, and the Unix source code was licensable via agreements with its owner, AT&T. The first known software license was sold to the University of Illinois in 1975.

Unix grew quickly in academia, with Berkeley becoming a significant center of activity, given Ken Thompson's sabbatical there in the '70s. With all the activity around Unix at Berkeley, a new delivery of Unix software was born: the Berkeley Software Distribution, or BSD. Initially, BSD was not an alternative to AT&T's Unix, but an add-on with additional software and capabilities. By the time 2BSD (the Second Berkeley Software Distribution) arrived in 1979, Bill Joy, a Berkeley grad student, had added now-famous programs such asvi and the C shell (/bin/csh).

In addition to BSD, which became one of the most popular branches of the Unix family, Unix's commercial offerings exploded through the 1980s and into the '90s with names like HP-UX, IBM's AIX, Sun's Solaris, Sequent, and Xenix. As the branches grew from the original root, the ""Unix wars"" began, and standardization became a new focus for the community. The POSIX standard was born in 1988, as well as other standardization follow-ons via The Open Group into the 1990s.

Around this time AT&T and Sun released System V Release 4 (SVR4), which was adopted by many commercial vendors. Separately, the BSD family of operating systems had grown over the years, leading to some open source variations that were released under the now-familiar BSD license. This included FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD, each with a slightly different target market in the Unix server industry. These Unix variants continue to have some usage today, although many have seen their server market share dwindle into the single digits (or lower). BSD may have the largest install base of any modern Unix system today. Also, every Apple Mac hardware unit shipped in recent history can be claimed by BSD, as its OS X (now macOS) operating system is a BSD-derivative.

While the full history of Unix and its academic and commercial variants could take many more pages, for the sake of our article focus, let's move on to the rise of Linux.
Enter Linux
What we call the Linux operating system today is really the combination of two efforts from the early 1990s. Richard Stallman was looking to create a truly free and open source alternative to the proprietary Unix system. He was working on the utilities and programs under the name GNU, a recursive acronym meaning ""GNU's not Unix!"" Although there was a kernel project underway, it turned out to be difficult going, and without a kernel, the free and open source operating system dream could not be realized. It was Linus Torvald's work—producing a working and viable kernel that he called Linux—that brought the complete operating system to life. Given that Linus was using several GNU tools (e.g., the GNU Compiler Collection, or GCC), the marriage of the GNU tools and the Linux kernel was a perfect match.

Linux distributions came to life with the components of GNU, the Linux kernel, MIT's X-Windows GUI, and other BSD components that could be used under the open source BSD license. The early popularity of distributions like Slackware and then Red Hat gave the ""common PC user"" of the 1990s access to the Linux operating system and, with it, many of the proprietary Unix system capabilities and utilities they used in their work or academic lives.

Because of the free and open source standing of all the Linux components, anyone could create a Linux distribution with a bit of effort, and soon the total number of distros reached into the hundreds. Of course, many developers utilize Linux either via cloud providers or by using popular free distributions like Fedora, Canonical's Ubuntu, Debian, Arch Linux, Gentoo, and many other variants. Commercial Linux offerings, which provide support on top of the free and open source components, became viable as many enterprises, including IBM, migrated from proprietary Unix to offering middleware and software solutions atop Linux. Red Hat built a model of commercial support around Red Hat Enterprise Linux, as did German provider SUSE with SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES).

Comparing Unix and Linux
So far, we've looked at the history of Unix and the rise of Linux and the GNU/Free Software Foundation underpinnings of a free and open source alternative to Unix. Let's examine the differences between these two operating systems that share much of the same heritage and many of the same goals.

From a user experience perspective, not very much is different! Much of the attraction of Linux was the operating system's availability across many hardware architectures (including the modern PC) and ability to use tools familiar to Unix system administrators and users.

 ","The open-source clone of Unix created in the early 1990s is **Linux**, developed by Finnish software engineer **Linus Torvalds** in 1991 [2][3][4]. While still a student at the University of Helsinki, Torvalds began writing a Unix-like kernel inspired by MINIX, a small teaching-oriented Unix system [2][3]. He released the first version (0.02) in 1991, and by 1994, version 1.0 of the Linux kernel was available [2].

Linux was not developed in isolation. Around the same time, **Richard Stallman** and the **Free Software Foundation (FSF)** had been working on the **GNU Project**, which aimed to create a free Unix-like operating system [2][3][4]. Although GNU had developed many essential tools and utilities, it lacked a working kernel. The combination of Torvalds' Linux kernel with GNU tools resulted in a complete, open-source Unix-like system, often referred to as **GNU/Linux** [2][3][4].

Unlike traditional Unix systems, which were proprietary, Linux was released under the **GNU General Public License (GPL)**, allowing anyone to use, modify, and distribute the software freely [3][5]. This open-source model led to rapid adoption and the creation of numerous Linux distributions, such as Red Hat, Debian, and SUSE [3][4].

In summary, **Linux** is the open-source Unix-like operating system created in the early 1990s, combining Linus Torvalds' kernel with GNU software to form a complete and freely available alternative to proprietary Unix systems [2][3][4].","[(0.0, 0.0), (0.32089554049199676, 1.0), (0.36567163204277103, 0.9863756138459696), (0.26865673591445804, 0.6939753263863936), (0.044776091550774194, 0.06602587136183975)]","[(-0.06481480838330425, -0.06042229206321102), (-0.07725260122464084, 0.0), (0.03233829870943772, 0.11031877705255633), (0.12976782773103743, 0.21856476465827168), (-0.020038716832530057, -0.04180468062789068)]"

CarrierDownload a PDF of this postPassages of Arms:The English Bill of Rights and the American Second AmendmentChristopher D. Carrier*“Die Weltgeschichte ist das Weltgericht.”—Friedrich Schiller[1]I. IntroductionThe 1689 Bill of Rights is a major component of the unwritten British constitution, alongside Magna Carta and the 1628 Petition of Right.[2] The Convention Parliament, not summoned by any monarch, offered the throne to William and Mary in conjunction with their acceptance of the 13 February 1689 (NS) Declaration of Rights.[3] Whether William and Mary’s acceptance of the Crown was conditioned on acceptance of the Declaration of Rights is a matter of bluntness. Subtly and conciliatorily, Parliament’s own website history article explains that “[c]ontrary to common belief, Parliament did not present the Declaration to William and Mary as a condition which they had to accept to be made King and Queen.”[4] The Parliamentary history webpage notes that the Convention Parliament had already, on 6 February 1689, resolved to offer the Crown to William and Mary.[5] This is true, but it is also true that no offer was conveyed until the grand ceremonial reading of the Declaration of Rights, and when the Declaration was recorded as a statute, the official account of the acceptance appended to the declared rights sounded patently transactional: “Upon which their said Majestyes did accept the Crowne and Royall Dignitie of the Kingdoms of England France and Ireland and the Dominions thereunto belonging according to the Resolution and Desire of the said Lords and Commons contained in the said Declaration.”[6] A constitutional scholar later described the Convention Parliament’s approach as setting out constitutional principles “in the instrument by which the Prince and Princess of Orange were called to the throne . . . so that the right of the king to his crown and of the people to their liberties might rest upon one and the same title-deed.”[7] If the Declaration of Rights was not crassly expressed as a condition of the offered Crown, it was nonetheless inextricably bound up with the political and legal conditions under which William and Mary became elective monarchs. If the “common belief” on this point is mistaken, it is perhaps a salutary mistake that keeps non-specialists from missing the larger point.Historical and legal ambiguity and nuance adhere not only to the circumstance of the 1689 Bill of Rights but also to its Article VII in which the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons, declared that their rights and liberties included “[t]hat the Subjects which are Protestants may have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions, and as allowed by Law.”[8] Scholarly debate on this article’s meaning—in history and in law—has raged in America for the last few decades and reached the United States Supreme Court in 2008 in District of Columbia v. Heller, a case interpreting the American Constitution’s Second Amendment.[9] The majority and dissenting opinions engaged in a spirited debate on the relevance of the English Bill of Rights, citing the works of Professor Lois G. Schwoerer, America’s leading authority on the English Bill of Rights,[10] and those of Joyce Lee Malcolm, a historian who argued that American colonial leaders believed the liberties of Englishmen included an individual right to bear arms. More specifically, Professor Malcolm argued that Article VII established an individually-held right as part of the British constitution.[11] This historical view was juridically ratified by the Heller decision.In a book published after Heller, Professor Schwoerer acknowledged the decision’s finality in the context of American law, but she maintained that the Heller court and Professor Malcolm are wrong regarding certain points of historical fact and their necessary implications. Gun Culture in Early Modern England, published in 2016, is a book primarily about the origin and early development of the English firearms industry and the enthusiasm for firearms among the upper crust of English society in Tudor and Stuart England.[12] The book’s conclusion, however, is a sustained attack on Professor Malcolm’s published views on the meaning and consequence of Article VII.[13] Although Professor Schwoerer is not a lawyer, her language is prosecutorial: Professor Malcolm “admits” or “confesses” certain things, and her interpretation is “inadmissible.”[14] The chapter concludes with a thoroughgoing denunciation of Professor Malcolm’s assertion of continuity between the English Bill of Rights and America’s Second Amendment: “If the Americans did grant an individual right to arms, as the United States Supreme Court ruled, they got that idea from someplace other than the 1689 English Bill of Rights.”[15]Professor Schwoerer refused to yield the historical battlefield in light of the legal defeat. She adhered to the position she stated in a law review article in 2000: “There was no ancient political or legal precedent for the right to arms.”[16]II. A Series of Passages of ArmsLois G. Schwoerer is Professor Emerita at George Washington University’s Columbian College of Arts and Sciences, and Joyce Lee Malcolm is Professor Emerita at George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School.[17] Both are historians by training and experience; neither is a lawyer. Like the French military officers in Joseph Conrad’s novella The Duel, they have exchanged cuts and salvos in books and articles disputing certain historical facts and points of interpretation over the course of many years. They are hardly the lone combatants in this field. Still, they are the champions for each camp on specific points of history relevant to Anglo-American law, to wit, the English Bill of Rights and the scope of private firearms ownership in England in past centuries.In 1994, Professor Malcolm distilled many years’ work into a book describing her view that the English Bill of Rights of 1689 was a landmark event in Anglo-American legal history. To Keep and Bear Arms[18] argued that, broadly speaking, the right of the English population to privately hold arms “was born in 1689.”[19] She considered the characterization of this right in the Bill of Rights as “ancient” as a Whig rhetorical flourish, but she found evidence that the right to bear arms became widely accepted as a British constitutional principle, which then was imported into the American constitution as a traditionally held right of the people.[20]To Keep and Bear Arms was generally well-received and well-reviewed.[21] In 1994, law professors Robert J. Cottrol and Raymond T. Diamond were among those who favorably reviewed To Keep and Bear Arms.[22] Their review included considerable comment on eras beyond the temporal focus of To Keep and Bear Arms, which contained only a brief “Afterword” on British and American history following the ratification of America’s Second Amendment.Professor Schwoerer’s 1995 review of To Keep and Bear Arms was critical but not entirely dismissive.[23] The review insisted that the 1689 Bill of Rights “did not mean to confer a universal right to possess arms” as evidenced by its “careful limiting language.”[24] However, she agreed that the book was “both provocative and instructive” even if “some may conclude that its thesis has not been proved.”[25] Professor Schwoerer commended the work for “showing the influence of the English legacy and William Blackstone’s Commentaries on the Laws of England on the Second Amendment to the American Bill of Rights.”[26] By the standards of gun rights discourse, this was civility.In a much more heated review in 1996, Professor Michael Bellesiles called To Keep and Bear Arms “a fascinating work of advocacy” that presented “a revisionist record” of British history.[27] After having accused Professor Malcolm of exaggerating her case for widespread possession of firearms in Britain, Professor Bellesiles favored the reader with quite a sweeping statement of his own: “Gun ownership in Britain, as in America at the same time, was a collective right, collectively denied.”[28] He also asserts that William Blackstone was “struck,” whatever that may mean, by the limitations contained in Article VII of the 1689 Bill of Rights.[29] Professor Malcolm took the unusual step of responding to this review, decrying Professor Bellesiles’s “lamentable lack of objectivity and to a signal failure to come to grips with unpleasant evidence.”[30] Her criticisms were well-founded. In 2000, Professor Bellesiles published Arming America: The Origins of a National Gun Culture, which argued the extraordinary thesis that few people in early America owned guns, apparently in an effort to challenge interpretations of the original understanding of the Second Amendment that relied in part on widespread private gun ownership during the colonial period.[31] The book excited the collective-right scholars and won the 2001 Bancroft Prize, but it did not withstand scrutiny showing that the book based its thesis on fraudulent research. The Bancroft Prize was rescinded, and Mr. Bellesiles resigned his position in 2002.[32]Professor Bellesiles would soon be hors du combat, but for whatever reasons, by 2000, Professor Schwoerer’s views on To Keep and Bear Arms had apparently hardened in comparison with the views she had expressed in her 1995 book review, and she took up the cudgels in a law review article (titled “To Hold and Bear Arms”) that was a direct attack.[33] “To dissent from Malcolm’s interpretation,” she noted, “some might say, is foolhardy” in light of the generally positive reviews of Professor Malcolm’s work.[34] Nevertheless, her article offered both specific and broad criticisms of To Keep and Bear Arms.Professor Schwoerer described the parliamentary debate on abuses of the Stuart kings, including their creation of a standing army, in peacetime and without parliament’s consent, under the 1661 Militia Act.[35] Relying on the extant records of the parliamentary debates, Professor Schwoerer demonstrated that Professor Malcolm was probably mistaken in her interpretation of “elliptically reported comments by a Tory, the Honorable Heneage Finch, in the debate on 28 January 1689.”[36] Professor Schwoerer’s broader conclusions are less convincing. She opined that we know by reference to Erasmus, Sir Thomas More, and James Harrington, that the “Renaissance heritage” favored the militia over the professional army, but she insisted that this pro-militia sentiment must not be confused with an individual right to arms.[37] Based on her reading of the debates and the historical context, she concluded as an historian:The idea, then, of giving individual Protestants the right to provide and keep arms must have been a response to immediate experience. It almost certainly came from members who may have remembered the moves toward arming the populace taken a decade before, and who had received rough treatment at the hands of a zealous militia operating under the command of the king during the two previous reigns.[38]She argued that there was no intent to create a right, and no such effect, in that the three forms of restriction (Protestantism, socioeconomic “condition,” and the crucial qualifier “as allowed by law”) vitiated any real effect in the form of widespread individual gun ownership.[39]In light of these historical conclusions, Professor Schwoerer made express her legal conclusions on the matter:There was no ancient political or legal precedent for the right to arms. The Ancient Constitution did not include it; it was neither in Magna Charta 1215 nor in the Petition of Right 1628. No early English government would have considered giving the individual such a right.[40]. . . .. . . Article VII is properly regarded not as a gun-rights law, but as a gun-control measure. It gives no right to all Protestants to possess guns; it gives that right to upper-class Protestants. In effect, it armed a small minority—perhaps no more than three percent—of the population. This, I submit, was the original meaning of Article VII.[41]Professor Schwoerer’s academic clash with Professor Malcolm was covered in the paper of record, which interviewed her prior to the article’s publication. Professor Schwoerer said in an interview that Professor Malcolm’s conclusions were “unthinkable” and “very bad history” which involved “errors in interpretation and handling of evidence.”[42] The context of the Times article was scholarly participation in United States v. Emerson.[43] Emerson apparently seemed like a big deal at the time, but soon would come District of Columbia v. Heller.Justice Antonin Scalia’s majority opinion in Heller noted that the two sides in the case presented “very different interpretations” of the Second Amendment, with one side arguing that it protects “only the right to possess and carry a firearm in connection with militia service,” while the other side saw “an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home.”[44] In reviewing the Anglo-American history, Justice Scalia cited Professors Malcolm and Schwoerer jointly for the uncontroversial assertion that the Stuart kings had used the select militia to disarm their opponents.[45] Justice Scalia cited Professor Malcolm for a more controversial point: “[b]y the time of the founding, the right to have arms had become fundamental for English subjects.”[46] Crucially, his next sentence read, “Blackstone, whose works, we have said, ‘constituted the preeminent authority on English law for the founding generation,’ cited the arms provision of the Bill of Rights as one of the fundamental rights of Englishmen.”[47] The fact that Blackstone made this characterization is not susceptible to reasonable dispute.Professor Schwoerer was cited again by Justice Scalia in support of his characterization of the limitations on Article VII in the context of English law: “[t]o be sure, it was an individual right not available to the whole population, given that it was restricted to Protestants, and like all written English rights it was held only against the Crown, not Parliament.”[48] Query whether the succeeding “see” citation is entirely appropriate, as Justice Scalia’s point may be more accurately described as a rejoinder to the works cited than a reliance on them.[49] Professor Schwoerer’s reading of Article VII as a very limited right addressed to a very specific historical situation more closely accords with its use and citation in Justice John Paul Stevens’s dissent.[50]And so, Professor Schwoerer’s 2016 work, Gun Culture in Early Modern England, may be seen as, at least in part, a continuation of this controversy. Professor Schwoerer opens the book by imputing its origin not to the longstanding dispute that came to a head in Heller, but rather to her reflections on two “horrific gun massacres in Great Britain” in 1987 and 1996:[51]All this led me, as a historian of early modern England, to wonder what the English government and people in that earlier era thought about guns and gun possession. These questions lay unexplored in my mind for almost ten years as other projects preempted them, but they never completely faded.[52]This explanation is not incompatible with the book’s contentious polemic conclusion. Much of the book concerns the English gun industry’s reformation under Henry VIII, its commercial expansion, and the social history of gun use among the English aristocracy and gentry. As Professor Malcolm opened her 2017 review, “[t]he book presents new information about firearms manufacture in England and adds to current information on the use of guns by various social classes.”[53] The final passage of the book’s last substantive chapter, however, directly addresses the Second Amendment controversy and shows how much of the book was written in service of the Article VII feud.III. The Case Against Heller: Gun Culture in Early Modern EnglandProfessor Schwoerer described the importance of Henry VIII in building on the firearms infrastructure he inherited, including his recruitment and solicitous treatment of immigrating gun makers.[54] In that era, the gunmakers did not have a guild of their own but instead were obliged to join the Blacksmiths’ Guild, the Armourers’ Guild, or the Joiners’ Guild.[55] After an eighty-year struggle with the medieval guilds, the gunmakers received a charter from King Charles I on March 14, 1638 as “The Worshipfull [sic] Company of Gunmakers.”[56]One of the merits of Gun Culture is its Appendix A, “What Is a Gun?”, which contains some technical information about early modern firearms. A defect in the entire book is evident in a terminological shift from the Appendix’s title to its opening line: “What was a handgun that existed four to five hundred years ago in early modern England?”[57] Four pages later, after explaining the development of cannons, she returns to “the handgun, which by definition was a firearm that one person could discharge with or without a rest.”[58] That is of course not the modern definition of the word, and the book’s use of “gun” and “handgun” interchangeably can be confusing, especially with regard to Henry VIII’s arms control statute of 1541, which prescribed a minimum size (one whole yard) for legally-held private firearms to make concealment a practical impossibility.[59] Professor Schwoerer explained that “it allowed persons living outside urban areas to keep guns of the prescribed length to protect themselves, their family and their house,”[60] as well as those exempt because their annual income was above £100.[61] In her review of the book, Professor Malcolm pointed out that the scope of the exemption was broader than suggested by Professor Schwoerer and included many inhabitants of cities, boroughs, and market towns.[62]Indeed, throughout Gun Culture in Early Modern England, Professor Schwoerer tended to stress restriction and minimize indicia of widespread gun ownership, calling to mind what Michael Bellesiles’s book review said of Joyce Lee Malcolm: “[a]lternative readings of [her] research arise constantly.”[63] Although Professor Schwoerer emphasizes regulation and denies any thoroughgoing legal “right” to possess arms, this is simply her spin on facts that are subject to other interpretations, which she acknowledges cursorily:In [Convention Parliament] debate on the Act [disarming Catholics], John Maynard expressed the thought that Catholics should bring their “firearms in, unless for the necessary defence of their Houses.” Evidently, members of the Convention were sensitive to the natural and common law right of self-defense and did not deny it.[64]. . . .In 1689, one remembers, a gun was allowed for self-protection, even for Catholics, and in 1706 it was allowed for killing vermin. However, it could not be used in hunting.[65]Passages like these suggest that the debate about an English right is semantic to the point of turning on whether their conception of a right sufficiently matches our conception of a right. As discussed below, what we see in the seventeenth century debates is what we should expect to see in the way of an English political and legal antecedent to a modern American right.Professor Schwoerer described an élite gun culture but acknowledged that “[m]en down the social scale also wanted firearms and expressed opposition to the restrictions placed on their possessing and using them.”[66] Notably, she phrased this to emphasize the restriction. Similarly, in describing the Elizabethan gun industry’s opposition to the aristocracy’s efforts against “poaching” by the lower orders, Professor Schwoerer tended to emphasize the effort at restriction, rather than the evidence of widespread gun possession: “[t]he government’s condemnation of subjects’ using ‘pistols and birding pieces’ suggests not only how difficult it was to enforce gun restrictions but how popular guns were.”[67] Indeed—and the condemnation was on the use of the firearms, not the possession of them.As a work of social history, Gun Culture described the enthusiasm for firearms among the aristocracy and gentry and their desire to enforce robust game laws to keep the poorer classes from poaching. To this end, Professor Schwoerer described “two gun cultures” centered on men of high social standing, one military and one “domestic,” with a “focus” on the latter.[68] The “focus” on domestic gun culture as opposed to the military gun culture may partly explain the curious paucity of comment on the English Civil Wars. She noted at the outset that by military experience, generally, “men down the social scale learned about guns and participated in both cultures.”[69] Surely, however, service in the Civil Wars differed in light of their ideological component. Gun Culture in Early Modern England included only one sentence that even approached this point: “First, from 1642 to 1648 the Civil Wars brought into play armies, each composed of Englishmen of all socioeconomic standing, fighting each other.”[70]That sentence does not even acknowledge the social disruption of the Civil Wars, and on the page preceding it, Professor Schwoerer defended her linkage of gun culture and the higher orders:As late as World War I, war was still seen by English people as “the occupation of the nobility and gentry.” It was commonly held that a “British officer should be a gentleman first and an officer second.” Until World War II, the majority of officers came from the aristocracy.[71]This is generally true, but a book spending so much time in the seventeenth century might be expected to mention at least the existence of the New Model Army, which Gun Culture does not. Oliver Cromwell and the interregnum are mentioned only in passing. Sir Winston Churchill, a great hater of Oliver Cromwell, noted that the parliamentary forces in the Civil Wars were “led by men who had risen in the field and had no other standing but their military record and their religious zeal.”[72] “Oliver’s officers, said another account, were ‘not such as were soldiers or men of estate,’ but ‘common men, poor and of mean parentage,’ ‘such as have filled dung carts both before they were captains and since.’”[73] Crucially, this was not a failed uprising by the lower orders; it was a regime. The Civil Wars were not only long in duration, large in scale, and internecine, but also disruptive of the social order. In its defense of English gun culture as an élite phenomenon, the book omitted any serious consideration of the military experience of the middling and lower classes.Instead, the book closed with a nine-page polemic on the intent of the drafters of the 1689 Bill of Rights that began with an odd etymological argument, apparently originated by Garry Wills, that “arms” necessarily meant military weapons. “As Wills wittily put it, one does not use ‘arms’ to shoot a rabbit.”[74] The relevance of this assertion, even if true, is dubious when the question was private ownership of firearms for purposes including self-defense. In what was meant to be a clinching argument, Professor Schwoerer cited a 1660 letter from Charles II to his lord lieutenant in Buckinghamshire:The king wrote that the court had “certain knowledge” that “persons of Loose Principles and knowne disaffection to us and our government” were so heavily armed that they must intend an uprising. He instructed Bridgewater to employ the militia to seize “any quantity [of “arms”] . . . discovered in a house . . . above what may reasonably be believed necessary for [the person’s] safeguard and defence.” Here, too, “Arms” are differentiated from what weapon an individual might need for personal defense.[75]Surely the “quantity” of arms “above” that necessary to self-defense was the apparent concern, not some qualitative distinction between “arms” and weapons for self-defense.Next, Professor Schwoerer dilated on the importance in Article VII of the Bill of Rights of two qualifying phrases: “suitable to their conditions” and “as allowed by law.”[76] It was largely by her reading of these qualifications that Professor Schwoerer concluded that “Article VII did not grant an individual right to all English Protestant subjects to possess a gun, and that it was not the progenitor of the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.”[77] Her conflation of these two concepts is profoundly unhelpful.IV. The English Bill of Rights as Political and Legal PrecedentSurely an expert on British parliamentary history—even if not a lawyer by training—must be familiar with the principle of parliamentary supremacy. The Civil Wars and the Glorious Revolution cemented this principle in political reality. Sovereignty resides in the Crown‑in‑Parliament, its absolute power classically stated by Blackstone:It can regulate or new model the succession to the crown; as was done in the reign of Henry VIII. and William III. It can alter the established religion of the land; as was done in a variety of instances, in the reigns of King Henry VIII. and his three children. It can change and create afresh even the constitution of the kingdom and of parliaments themselves; as was done by the act of union, and the several statutes for triennial and septennial elections. It can, in short, do everything that is not naturally impossible . . . .[78]If Professor Schwoerer did not immediately see the relevance of this principle to the question of whether Article VII should be construed as a British constitutional right—and how that would differ from a right under the written American Constitution, it was explicitly pointed out in 1994 by the Cottrol-Diamond review of To Keep and Bear Arms: “Under British constitutional doctrine of Parliamentary supremacy, the provision could not restrict subsequent acts of Parliament.”[79] Rights of any kind were held against the monarch, not against parliament. The harmonization of the Bill of Rights with existing laws such as the Militia Act and the game laws was an example of the British legal system at work.If we try to convert the traditional British constitution into something analogous to the modern concept—that is, to treat it as a set of rules establishing and regulating the activity of governing—the constitution may seem random. It is revealed as a miscellaneous collection of statutes, rules, and guidelines, none of which constitute ‘higher law’ and many of which make no sense until they are interpreted in the light of innumerable political understandings.[80]An authority on the British constitution writing in 1879 annotated Article VII by noting that Blackstone’s description of the article as a “public allowance” must be understood in conjunction with both preexisting and subsequent statutes.[81] The qualification “as allowed by law” was merely a recitation, akin to an American statute or rule including the phrase “except as required by the Constitution.” Its inclusion or omission changes nothing.As to the limitation that arms be suitable to the “conditions” of various persons, such was the understanding before equality before the law was established.[82] Rights were not universal; they were particular and stratified. “Virtually every male in [colonial] Virginia could be ranked according to the size of animals that he was allowed to kill for pleasure.”[83] And that is an example of how English law was understood, even as adapted to local conditions. The later theory of the English common law’s transference to America was a legal fiction, not a seventeenth century practice. In Virginia, for example, codes—draconian in character, and codes in the first place—were promulgated in 1612, 1620, and 1662 with English common law’s subsidiary role very much in doubt even as a matter of principle.[84] This important distinction between what happened (legal history) and the accepted legal theory of the transfer of the common law to America demonstrates an important point about the role of history in law.People living in the British colonies in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries were in some confusion about whether they lived in places controlled by the English common law. Indeed, Blackstone’s conceptual framework for the role of English common law in lands other than England and Wales under British rule (“plantations or colonies in distant countries”) distinguished between those “where the lands are claimed by right of occupancy only, by finding them desart and uncultivated, and peopling them from the mother country” and those “gained by conquest or ceded to us by treaties.”[85] The “American plantations are principally of this latter sort, being obtained in the last century either by right of conquest and driving out the natives (with what natural justice I shall not at present enquire) or by treaties.”[86] Being in this category meant they were “no part of the mother country” but rather dependent dominions (like Ireland) subject to the will of Parliament but “not bound by common acts of parliament, unless particularly named,” and not under the English common law.[87]This theory was not universally accepted, however, and legislative authorities in the various colonies expressed divergent views. In 1684, proving that Blackstone’s view of the subject was not an innovation, both houses of the Maryland Assembly bristled at being characterized by a British authority as a conquered or subject people for purposes of deciding the governing legal paradigm.[88] The Pennsylvania Assembly in 1718 opined that it was a “settled point” that “the common law is the birthright of English subjects,” but agreed with Blackstone that “Acts of Parliament have been adjudged not to extend to these plantations, unless they are particularly named in such acts.”[89] Americans seem to have preferred the language of a 1720 Attorney-General opinion, written in the context of a dispute in Jamaica, regardless of whether it was strictly applicable to their situations:The common law of England is the common law of the plantations, and all statutes in affirmance of the common law, passed in England antecedent to the settlement of a colony, are in force in that colony, unless there is some private Act to the contrary; though no statutes, made since those settlements, are thus in force unless the colonists are particularly mentioned. Let an Englishman go where he will, he carries as much of law and liberty with him as the nature of things will bear.[90]Given the conflicting legal paradigms and the disputes as to which statutes and how much of the common law applied in any particular overseas colony, it makes sense that an American essayist in the early eighteenth century would opine, “No one can tell what is law and what is not in the plantations.”[91]American colonial enthusiasm for English common law increased as legal sophistication increased and as Americans looked for justifications for their claims of political rights. As Professor Reinsch described the shift, “The struggles with the mother country caused a wide spread of legal knowledge, and the common law came to be revered as a muniment of personal liberties. Blackstone was outdone by American lawyers in extravagant panegyrics.”[92]I rehearse some of this untidy history in part to contrast it with the tidiness of Justice Joseph Story’s theory of presumptive transfer. Writing as a circuit court judge in United States v. Wonson,[93] and as a Supreme Court justice in Van Ness v. Pacard,[94] Justice Story championed the view that English common law tradition was the “grand reservoir” of our jurisprudence, except as departure was justified by American conditions. “The common law of England is not to be taken in all respects to be that of America. Our ancestors brought with them its general principles, and claimed it as their birthright; but they brought with them and adopted only that portion which was applicable to their situation.”[95]Professor Reinsch summarized this theory as the legal fiction that “the common law was from the first looked upon by the colonists as a system of positive and subsidiary law, applying where not replaced by colonial enactments or by special custom suited to the new conditions.”[96] He approved of the simplified theory’s utility while noting that “it is not complete enough to afford an adequate synthesis of colonial legal facts for the historian.”[97] Although “the reception of the English common law by the colonies was not so simple as the legal theory would lead us to assume,”[98] he implied no doctrinal legal consequence to his elaboration of the historical facts.To illustrate by an analogy, historians must understand that the validity of a scientific theory is not always the heart of the matter when discussing the history of science. “Rain follows the plow,” believed Charles Dana Wilber, arguing that farmers could change the weather by overturning the soil.[99] More recently, his work has been, to use a word dear to historians, “discredited.” Nevertheless, his theory may have contributed to the settlement of the Great Plains because some people believed it at that time. I am not defending the use of bad history in the context of law, but I am defending the use of history according to the context of law. Given sequential eras A, B, and C, what people in Era B believed about Era A may be political and legal precedent in Era C. Correction of the historical record may allow people in Era C to understand Era A more accurately, but the ship has sailed with regard to political and legal precedent. Americans of the Revolutionary generation believed the liberties of Englishmen were their birthright. If historical inquiry shows that in some sense they were rewriting their own legal history, that does not prove that they did not believe what they wrote on this subject. And the liberties of Englishmen the founding generation believed belonged to them were those described by Blackstone.“When Blackstone’s Commentaries were published (1765–69), Americans were among his most avid customers. At last there was an up-to-date shortcut to the basic themes of English law.”[100] The Commentaries became “ubiquitous on the American legal scene” and “the Bible even in far-off jurisdictions.”[101] As I noted above, Justice Scalia’s decision in Heller contained a single sentence how Blackstone made the English Bill of Rights a political and legal precedent to the American Second Amendment: “Blackstone, whose works, we have said, ‘constituted the preeminent authority on English law for the founding generation,’ cited the arms provision of the Bill of Rights as one of the fundamental rights of Englishmen.”[102]Robert J.

Diamond, whose extended book review of Professor Malcolm’s To Keep and Bear Arms I have noted above, are lawyers, and their review made this connection quite clearly.[103] Placing Blackstone’s role as the bridge between English and American law in the foreground, the law review article was titled The Fifth Auxiliary Right, highlighting Blackstone’s position that a right to bear arms was a protection of the other liberties of Englishmen: “Blackstone understood these auxiliary rights as the mechanisms that protected the subjects’ natural or inherent rights.”[104] This point of British constitutional law, whatever it may have meant to the drafters of the English Bill of Rights, was mediated to colonial America by Blackstone’s Commentaries in this form.Contra this understanding of the matter, Professor Schwoerer asks, “Is this really what Blackstone wrote and meant to say?”[105] She reiterated her irrelevant point about the right not being “unrestricted,” concluding “Blackstone’s language shows that he was not advocating an unrestricted right of the individual to have arms.”[106] Similarly, Justice Scalia did not opine that the American Second Amendment is an unrestricted right of the individual to have arms.As noted above, Professor Schwoerer’s 1995 review of To Keep and Bear Arms commended the book for its “decided contribution” in “showing the influence of the English legacy and William Blackstone’s Commentaries on the Laws of England on the Second Amendment to the American Bill of Rights.”[107] This may be the middle ground on which many of the belligerents might meet, and those not wishing to be belligerent may stake a place between the camps. Whatever the 1689 Bill of Rights meant to its drafters, what it meant to colonial American leaders was what Blackstone told them it meant.In an oddly worded sentence in an earlier paragraph of the book review, Professor Schwoerer presaged this view of the subject: “It is not so much the legacy of the 1689 Bill of Rights as it is the subsequent readings of that article in the different circumstances of postrevolutionary eighteenth-century England that lie au fond of our Second Amendment.”[108] Query why Professor Schwoerer distinguishes the “subsequent readings” of Article VII from its “legacy.” For a lawyer for the working day, there is no meaningful distinction.In Gun Culture in Early Modern England, Professor Schwoerer insisted that the limitations of Article VII prove that it was not the political and legal precedent for the Second Amendment, saying as part of her summation, “If the Americans ‘swept’ away the restrictions of religion, socioeconomic status, and ‘as allowed by law,’ then, logically, they were not following the terms of Article VII.”[109] The word “swept” was in quotation marks because she was responding to Professor Malcolm’s assertion that “Americans swept aside these limitations and forbade any ‘infringement’ upon the right of the people to keep and bear arms.”[110] Professor Malcolm’s assertion accords with the difference between British and American constitutional law, our rejection of religious tests, and our ongoing project of eliminating status-based discrimination in the law. My only quibble with Professor Malcolm would be on the verb tense; it would be more accurate to use the present continuous tense: we are sweeping aside such limitations.V. ConclusionAs a forensic matter, Professor Schwoerer may have lost this fight when she acknowledged, in a sentence in her 2000 article attacking Professor Malcolm, that the debate on continuity is not strictly a matter of the intent of the drafters of the 1689 Bill of Rights, the subject on which Professor Schwoerer is the greater expert. The debate has interpretative and political components. “There was no ancient political or legal precedent for the right to arms,” Professor Schwoerer asserted.[111] In this context, “ancient” does not mean pre-medieval; it means the Whiggish interpretation of the common law and the British constitution. As argued above regarding the reception of the common law and the mediation of English law to the colonies by Blackstone’s Commentaries, even an historical misconception written into law by courts and legislatures and state and national conventions becomes the law, and valid legal precedent, regardless of its historical merits. On both sides of the Atlantic, especially in an era before social science research was available to political and legal authorities, popular and élite perceptions are political precedents.On the interpretation of the Second Amendment in American law, Professor Schwoerer recognized that “the point is now settled, at least for the time being.”[112] Her book in rebuttal has been cited in one reported case by the dissent. In a Delaware case decided on state constitutional grounds, the battle over Anglo-American history was again joined, and the minority would not yield to the majority (historical) opinion in Heller:Our friends in the Majority ground an unwritten right to bear arms in our English law heritage. But the English regulatory tradition does not support the notion that our founders considered our English law heritage to be the source of an unwritten right to bear arms. In fact, one of the only things the nine federal Justices who were split five-to-four in Heller agreed on was that any right to bear arms in England was subject to restriction by Parliament.[113]This essay explained above why an English right being “subject to restriction by Parliament” is a truism, not a point of any consequence.Professor Schwoerer’s pre-Heller work has also been cited once in a case decided after Heller and McDonald v. Chicago[114] when the Seventh Circuit was asked to side with Professor Schwoerer’s interpretation of history over Professor Malcolm’s view. “The parties and the amici curiae have treated us to hundreds of pages of argument, in nine briefs. The main focus of these submissions is history.”[115] The court noted submissions relying on work by collective right advocates such as Saul Cornell, Lois G. Schwoerer, Paul Finkelman, Don Higginbotham, and Roy Weatherup.[116] The court held that the historical debate was settled as a matter of law: “The Supreme Court rejected the argument. The appellees ask us to repudiate the Court’s historical analysis. That we can’t do. Nor can we ignore the implication of the analysis that the constitutional right of armed self-defense is broader than the right to have a gun in one’s home.”[117]Like historians, journalists are often scandalized and infuriated by what lawyers and judges do. Often cases have been written about by journalists who establish, to their two-source journalistic satisfaction, that they know what happened. The journalists then write articles declaring the legal process a travesty. Similarly, frustrated historians perceive lawyers as failing to appreciate some nuance in the thinking of past generations. Their objections often have some validity, but lawyers do not claim to be writing history when they examine history for purposes of legal analysis. Every profession is self-governing, and historical expertise is not a license to practice law.

Carrier\nPassages of Arms:\nThe English Bill of Rights and the American Second Amendment\nChristopher D. Carrier\nI. Introduction\nThe 1689 Bill of Rights is a major component of the unwritten British constitution, alongside Magna Carta and the 1628 Petition of Right. The Convention Parliament, not summoned by any monarch, offered the throne to William and Mary in conjunction with their acceptance of the 13 February 1689 (NS) Declaration of Rights. Whether William and Mary’s acceptance of the Crown was conditioned on acceptance of the Declaration of Rights is a matter of bluntness. Subtly and conciliatorily, Parliament’s own website history article explains that “[c]ontrary to common belief, Parliament did not present the Declaration to William and Mary as a condition which they had to accept to be made King and Queen.” The Parliamentary history webpage notes that the Convention Parliament had already, on 6 February 1689, resolved to offer the Crown to William and Mary. This is true, but it is also true that no offer was conveyed until the grand ceremonial reading of the Declaration of Rights, and when the Declaration was recorded as a statute, the official account of the acceptance appended to the declared rights sounded patently transactional: “Upon which their said Majestyes did accept the Crowne and Royall Dignitie of the Kingdoms of England France and Ireland and the Dominions thereunto belonging according to the Resolution and Desire of the said Lords and Commons contained in the said Declaration.” A constitutional scholar later described the Convention Parliament’s approach as setting out constitutional principles “in the instrument by which the Prince and Princess of Orange were called to the throne . . . so that the right of the king to his crown and of the people to their liberties might rest upon one and the same title-deed.” If the Declaration of Rights was not crassly expressed as a condition of the offered Crown, it was nonetheless inextricably bound up with the political and legal conditions under which William and Mary became elective monarchs. If the “common belief” on this point is mistaken, it is perhaps a salutary mistake that keeps non-specialists from missing the larger point.\n\nHistorical and legal ambiguity and nuance adhere not only to the circumstance of the 1689 Bill of Rights but also to its Article VII in which the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons, declared that their rights and liberties included “[t]hat the Subjects which are Protestants may have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions, and as allowed by Law.” Scholarly debate on this article’s meaning—in history and in law—has raged in America for the last few decades and reached the United States Supreme Court in 2008 in District of Columbia v. Heller, a case interpreting the American Constitution’s Second Amendment. The majority and dissenting opinions engaged in a spirited debate on the relevance of the English Bill of Rights, citing the works of Professor Lois G. Schwoerer, America’s leading authority on the English Bill of Rights, and those of Joyce Lee Malcolm, a historian who argued that American colonial leaders believed the liberties of Englishmen included an individual right to bear arms. More specifically, Professor Malcolm argued that Article VII established an individually-held right as part of the British constitution. This historical view was juridically ratified by the Heller decision.\n\nIn a book published after Heller, Professor Schwoerer acknowledged the decision’s finality in the context of American law, but she maintained that the Heller court and Professor Malcolm are wrong regarding certain points of historical fact and their necessary implications. Gun Culture in Early Modern England, published in 2016, is a book primarily about the origin and early development of the English firearms industry and the enthusiasm for firearms among the upper crust of English society in Tudor and Stuart England. The book’s conclusion, however, is a sustained attack on Professor Malcolm’s published views on the meaning and consequence of Article VII. Although Professor Schwoerer is not a lawyer, her language is prosecutorial: Professor Malcolm “admits” or “confesses” certain things, and her interpretation is “inadmissible.” The chapter concludes with a thoroughgoing denunciation of Professor Malcolm’s assertion of continuity between the English Bill of Rights and America’s Second Amendment: “If the Americans did grant an individual right to arms, as the United States Supreme Court ruled, they got that idea from someplace other than the 1689 English Bill of Rights.”\n\nProfessor Schwoerer refused to yield the historical battlefield in light of the legal defeat. She adhered to the position she stated in a law review article in 2000: “There was no ancient political or legal precedent for the right to arms.”\n\nII. A Series of Passages of Arms\nLois G. Schwoerer is Professor Emerita at George Washington University’s Columbian College of Arts and Sciences, and Joyce Lee Malcolm is Professor Emerita at George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School. Both are historians by training and experience; neither is a lawyer. Like the French military officers in Joseph Conrad’s novella The Duel, they have exchanged cuts and salvos in books and articles disputing certain historical facts and points of interpretation over the course of many years. They are hardly the lone combatants in this field. Still, they are the champions for each camp on specific points of history relevant to Anglo-American law, to wit, the English Bill of Rights and the scope of private firearms ownership in England in past centuries.\n\nIn 1994, Professor Malcolm distilled many years’ work into a book describing her view that the English Bill of Rights of 1689 was a landmark event in Anglo-American legal history. To Keep and Bear Arms argued that, broadly speaking, the right of the English population to privately hold arms “was born in 1689.” She considered the characterization of this right in the Bill of Rights as “ancient” as a Whig rhetorical flourish, but she found evidence that the right to bear arms became widely accepted as a British constitutional principle, which then was imported into the American constitution as a traditionally held right of the people.\n\nTo Keep and Bear Arms was generally well-received and well-reviewed. In 1994, law professors Robert J. Cottrol and Raymond T. Diamond were among those who favorably reviewed To Keep and Bear Arms. Their review included considerable comment on eras beyond the temporal focus of To Keep and Bear Arms, which contained only a brief “Afterword” on British and American history following the ratification of America’s Second Amendment.\n\nProfessor Schwoerer’s 1995 review of To Keep and Bear Arms was critical but not entirely dismissive. The review insisted that the 1689 Bill of Rights “did not mean to confer a universal right to possess arms” as evidenced by its “careful limiting language.” However, she agreed that the book was “both provocative and instructive” even if “some may conclude that its thesis has not been proved.” Professor Schwoerer commended the work for “showing the influence of the English legacy and William Blackstone’s Commentaries on the Laws of England on the Second Amendment to the American Bill of Rights.” By the standards of gun rights discourse, this was civility.\n\nIn a much more heated review in 1996, Professor Michael Bellesiles called To Keep and Bear Arms “a fascinating work of advocacy” that presented “a revisionist record” of British history. After having accused Professor Malcolm of exaggerating her case for widespread po\n\n'}
 {'raw_text': 'Firearms regulation in the United KingdomThis article has multiple issues. Please help improve it or discuss these issues on the talk page. (Learn how and when to remove these template messages)In the United Kingdom, access by the general public to firearms is subject to some of the strictest control measures in the world.[1][2] Subject to licensing, members of the public may own rifles and shotguns. However, most handguns have been banned in Great Britain since the Dunblane school massacre in 1996. Handguns are permitted in Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man which have their own legislation. Scotland imposes an additional licensing regime on airguns, which is not mirrored in England and Wales.Mass shootings are extremely rare. There have only been five major shootings carried out by a civilian in British history: the 1987 Hungerford massacre; 1989 Monkseaton shootings;[3][4] the 1996 Dunblane massacre; the 2010 Cumbria shootings[5] and the 2021 Plymouth shooting.[6] Concerns are raised periodically over the availability of illegal firearms.[7][8][9]Summary[edit]Fully automatic and submachine-guns are ""prohibited weapons""[10] and require explicit permission from central government to own. Generally, such permits are not made available to private citizens. Semi-automatic rifles over .22 in (5.6 mm) and pistols are similarly ""prohibited"", although there are exceptions for pistols for use for the humane dispatch of animals (classed under section 5).[11] There are also limited exceptions permitting pistols both to preserve firearms of historic or technical interest (classed as section 7 firearms)[12] and to enable use by elite sports teams. Semi-automatic shotguns are restricted to a magazine capacity of no more than two shots and are held under Section 2 of the Firearms Act, although a \'multi-shot\' shotgun can be owned under section 1 (restricted firearms and ammunition) of the Firearms Act. Where the term \'multi-shot\' is used, this refers to either a semi-automatic or pump-action shotgun with no restriction on magazine capacity.[13] All other rifles and their ammunition are permitted with no limits as to magazine size, for permitted purposes, to include: target shooting, hunting, and historic and muzzle-loading weapons, as well as long-barrelled breech-loading pistols with a specific overall length, but not for self-defence since 1968; however if a home-owner is threatened they may be used in self-defence, so long as the force is reasonable.[14] Shotgun possession and use is also controlled, and even low-power air rifles and pistols, while permitted, are controlled to some extent. A Firearm Certificate issued by the police is required for all weapons and ammunition except air weapons of modest power (of muzzle energy not over 12 ft⋅lbf (16 J) for rifles, and 6 ft⋅lbf (8.1 J) for pistols). Shotguns with a capacity of three rounds or less (up to guns with a magazine holding no more than two rounds, in addition to one in the chamber) are subject to less stringent licensing requirements than other firearms and require a Shotgun Certificate; shotguns with higher capacity require a Firearm Certificate.Possession of live ammunition without an appropriate licence, or failure to store ammunition securely can lead to severe penalties. Ammunition for firearms may only be purchased and possessed by the holder of a Firearm Certificate relating to firearm capable of shooting that specific ammunition. Shotgun cartridges can legally be possessed by anybody over the age of 15 and no licence is required to possess such ammunition so long as the cartridges contain 5 or more shots.[15] However, a Shotgun Certificate must still be shown at time of purchase.[16]While Scotland has had its own parliament (Holyrood) since the Scotland Act 1998, power to legislate on firearms was reserved to Westminster, which led to tensions between the British and Scottish parliaments, with the Scottish government wanting to enact stricter laws.[17]In Northern Ireland, firearms control laws are primarily regulated by the Firearms (Northern Ireland) Order 2004, which is slightly different from the law in Great Britain.Legal classification[edit]Rifles[edit]UK law defines a ""rifle"" as a rifled firearm with a barrel longer than 30 cm (12 in), and a total length longer than 60 cm (24 in). Single-shot, bolt-action, Martini-action, lever-action (also called under-lever action) and revolver rifles and carbines are permitted, with certificate, in any calibre. Self-loading (also known as semi-automatic) or pump-action rifles are only permitted in .22 rimfire calibre.Pistols[edit]The 1997 law did not ban pistols as such and was drafted in terms of small firearms.[18]: 3.2 British law defines a ""pistol"" as a firearm with a barrel shorter than 30 cm (12 in) or a total length of less than 60 cm (24 in)[19] (this definition encompasses revolvers, revolving pistols). Only muzzle-loading pistols—including muzzle-loading revolvers—are permitted; in practice all such firearms use black powder—a Class 1 explosive—as the propellant. Small quantities of muzzle-loading pistols and revolvers in various calibres, which comply with the regulations, are manufactured.[20] All other pistols are mostly prohibited in Great Britain, with some exceptions such as pistols used for the humane dispatch of injured animals (such as deer) and some historical firearms.This law created a new market for ""long-barrelled revolvers"" and ""long-barrelled pistols"", firearms with a permanently attached extension to the grip, making them long enough to fit under the legal definition of a rifle. Long-barrelled pistols in single-shot, or long-barrelled revolvers, both of any calibre, or semi-automatic in .22 rimfire, are all permitted with a Firearm Certificate.[21]Specific models of blank-firing starting pistol that are ""readily convertible"" to fire live ammunition may also be either banned or require a Firearm Certificate. The Bruni Olympic .380 BBM blank-firing revolver was banned in 2010 on evidence that it was being illegally converted.[22][23]Shotguns[edit]Single-, double-, or triple-barrelled shotguns, or those with a lever-action, pump-action, or semi-automatic action and fixed magazine capacity of no more than 2 cartridges are permitted on a Shotgun Certificate as long as they meet the criteria of having a minimum barrel length of 24"", overall length of 40"", and a non-detachable magazine (if present).There\'s no limit on the number of guns or amount of ammunition that a Shotgun Certificate holder can acquire or possess at one time, although each shotgun must be recorded on the certificates.Cartridges obtained using a Shotgun Certificate must have at least 5 projectiles each with a maximum size of 0.36"". Other types of shotgun ammunition such as solid slugs can only be bought following the grant of an Firearm Certificate.Shotguns with a detachable magazine or larger fixed magazine are considered firearms and require a Section 1 Firearm Certificate (24"" rule and 40"" fixed overall length) or break action shotguns with a minimum 12"" barrel and overall 24"" fixed length.Airguns[edit]Airguns are firearms like any other according to the definition given in the Firearms Act 1968 at section 57(1).[24] However, with the exception of Scotland where a certificate is now required, they are exempt from the requirement that a Firearm Certificate or Shotgun Certificate need be obtained to possess or acquire them provided that they meet certain limits as to their power.Air pistols with a muzzle energy not exceeding 6 foot-pounds force (8.1 joules) and other airguns with muzzle energy not exceeding 12 ft⋅lbf (16 J) do not require a certificate and may be acquired, purchased and possessed by anyone over the age of 18 and who is not a prohibited person as specified in section 21 of the Act which relates to persons previously convicted of a crime.[25]The UK Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006 controls online or mail-order sales of airguns by way of trade or business; transactions must be finalised face-to-face although the contract of sale may take place at a distance.[26] The airgun may be sent by the seller to a Registered Firearms Dealer (who will act as the seller\'s agent in the sale) from whom the gun may be collected by the purchaser.The same Act introduced the requirement that a person selling airguns or ammunition for airguns by way of trade or business be a Registered Firearms Dealer.[27] It is not an offence for a private individual to sell an airgun to another person as long as both parties are not legally barred from possessing airguns and the transaction does not constitute a business activity.It became a crime to fire an air weapon beyond the boundary of any premises without the occupier\'s permission, and increased the lower age limit for buying or possessing an air weapon to 18 years.[28]From 10 February 2011 the Crime & Security Act 2010 (S.46) made it an offence ""for a person in possession of an air weapon to fail to take reasonable precautions to prevent any person under the age of eighteen from having the weapon with him"".[29]Any person who is in a building or is on land as a trespasser whilst having a firearm with them commits the offence of trespassing with a firearm.[30] It is immaterial whether or not they have any ammunition with them at the time or whether they actually intend to use it at the place in which they were trespassing.Ammunition[edit]Explosive, incendiary, noxious (biological, chemical) and armour-piercing ammunition types are ""prohibited"" for civilians.[10] The Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 (Section 9) generally prohibited expanding ammunition, but this conflicted with the Deer Act 1991 (which mandated its use for deer stalking).[31][32] An exemption permitted the acquisition and possession of expanding ammunition on Firearm Certificates held for game shooting or deer-stalking but not target shooting. Section 219 of the Policing and Crime Act 2017 modified the 1997 Act to only apply to Pistol ammunition.[33] The distinction is no longer made for rifles and expanding ammunition may be used for target shooting. The quantity of ammunition a Certificate Holder may possess is determined by Certificate conditions on a per-calibre basis.Shotgun cartridges are not restricted by certificate conditions and a Shotgun Certificate holder may acquire and possess as many as they like. Due to their bulky nature, normal shotgun cartridges are not subject to the same secure storage requirements as Section 1 ammunition. Solid slugs or cartridges containing fewer than 5 projectiles which are considered Section 1 and must be held on a Firearm Certificate.Prohibited firearms[edit]The following are generally prohibited:[34][35]- Fully automatic or burst-fire weapons, which may include some air guns.- Semi-automatic or pump-action rifles that fire centre-fire ammunition (e.g. Ruger Mini-14, L1A1).- Manually Actuated Release System Rifles (MARS) and Lever Release Rifles (not to be confused with Lever Action).- Most handguns, regardless of calibre.- Firearms disguised as another item (e.g. walking sticks, mobile telephones, etc.).- Rockets and mortars.- Air guns chambered for self-contained gas cartridges. (Existing owners prior to 20 January 2004 were allowed ownership subject to obtaining a Firearm Certificate).- Any weapon of whatever description designed or adapted for the discharge of any noxious liquid, gas or other substance. This would generally include stun guns, or electric shock devices, CS gas (tear gas), OC spray (pepper spray), etc. Cattle prods would not generally be included, but it would depend on the type.Firearms that previously fell into a prohibited category cannot be made legal if converted into an otherwise permitted form. For example, a pistol which is adapted by permanently fitting a 60-centimetre (24 in) long smooth-bore barrel to it does not thereby become permitted.[18]: 2.29Licensing of firearms[edit]With a few specialised exceptions, all firearms in the United Kingdom must be licensed on either a 5-year firearm certificate (FAC)[36] or a shotgun certificate (SGC) issued by the police for the area in which they normally reside. Each certificate can list multiple firearms.[37]Shotguns (Section 2 Firearms under the 1968 Act as amended) are defined in UK law as smoothbore firearms with barrels not shorter than 24 inches (61 cm) and a bore not larger than 2 inches (5.1 cm) in diameter, no revolving cylinder, and either no magazine or a non-detachable magazine that is not capable of holding more than two cartridges,[18] plus one in the chamber; shotguns with higher capacity require a firearm certificate. Shotguns thus defined are subject to a less rigorous certification process than for the full FAC; an applicant is not required by law to make a good case for being granted a certificate, but the police may withhold a certificate if they consider that the applicant does not have satisfactory security in place, or granting it would constitute a danger to public safety or to the peace.[38] A certificate holder may possess as many shotguns as can be securely stored.When applying for a firearm certificate, justification must be provided to the police for each firearm, and they are individually listed on the certificate by type, calibre, and serial number. A shotgun certificate similarly lists type, calibre and serial number, but permits possession of as many shotguns as can be safely accommodated. To gain permission for a new firearm, a ""variation"" must be sought, for a fee, unless the variation is made at the time of renewal, or unless it constitutes a one-for-one replacement of an existing firearm that will be disposed of. The certificate also sets out, by calibre, the maximum quantities of ammunition someone may possess at any one time, and is used to record ammunition purchases (except where ammunition is bought to use immediately on a range under s11 or s15 of the Firearms Act).To obtain a firearm certificate, the police must be satisfied that a person has ""good reason"" to own each firearm, and that they can be trusted with it ""without danger to the public safety or to the peace"". Under Home Office guidelines, Firearm Certificates are only issued if a person has legitimate sporting, collecting, or work-related reasons for ownership. Since 1968, self-defence has not been considered a valid reason to own a firearm.[39] The current licensing procedure involves: positive verification of identity, two referees of verifiable good character who have known the applicant for at least two years (and who may themselves be interviewed and/or investigated as part of the certification), approval of the application by the applicant\'s own family doctor, an inspection of the premises and cabinet where firearms will be kept and a face-to-face interview by a Firearms Enquiry Officer (FEO) also known as a Firearms Liaison Officer (FLO). Only when all these stages have been satisfactorily completed will a licence be issued, which must be renewed every 5 years.Any person who has been sentenced to between three months and three years in prison is automatically prohibited from possessing firearms (including airguns) and ammunition for five years from release. A person who has been sentenced to more than three years is prohibited for life.[25] Application may be made to a court to reverse these prohibitions and this is likely to be successful in relation to convictions for crimes which do not relate to a person\'s fitness to possess firearms. Similarly, persons applying for licences with recent, serious mental health issues will also be refused a certificate.Any person holding a Firearm or Shotgun Certificate must comply with strict storage conditions by storing their firearms/shotguns in a safe bolted to the floor or wall that complies to the standard BS 7558:1992.[40][41] These storage arrangements are checked by the police before a licence is first granted, and on every renewal of the licence.In the case of a firearm certificate the issuing police force may impose additional conditions over and above the statutory ones. However any condition appended to a certificate must be reasonable and must not be of such a restrictive nature as would amount to a constructive refusal to grant the certificate by making use so unlikely as to be practically impossible. Failure to comply with any of these conditions can result in criminal prosecution resulting in a prison sentence of up to six months. Revocation of the certificate is also possible, depending upon the nature of the breach.A visitors permit is available for possession of firearms without certificate by visitors to the UK.[42]The penalty for possession of any type of firearm without a certificate is a maximum of 14 years in prison and an unlimited fine. The penalty for section 5 categories of firearm is subject to a mandatory minimum of five years.[43] (Although the sentencing judge has discretion to depart from the minimum sentence if there are ""exceptional circumstances"").[44]The Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006 increased restrictions on the use, possession, sale and manufacture of both airguns and imitation firearms.[45]Pistols used for competitive target shooting[edit]Pistol shooting for sporting purposes has been effectively banned since 1997, although a temporary exemption was made for competitors to bring Section 5 firearms into the UK for the 2002 Commonwealth Games. This exemption only applied to the Games period and Home Nation pistol shooters had to train abroad prior to the Games.[46][47] Ahead of the 2012 Olympic Games, Tessa Jowell (Minister for the Olympics) and the Home Secretary agreed to use Home Office powers to issue a small number of Section 5 Permits to elite pistol shooters nominated by British Shooting.[48] With Glasgow winning the right to host the 2014 Commonwealth Games, this arrangement was continued after the 2012 Olympics, with a small number of UK ranges licensed for Section 5 shooting.[49]A few models of single-shot .22 calibre free pistol, as used in the 50 m Olympic \'Free Pistol\' match, have been produced to meet the ""long-barrelled pistol"" conditions. Some free pistols have removable stabiliser bars extending backwards to improve stability; the UK-legal models have been made with non-removable stabilisers to extend the dimensions, instead of contrived and non-functional grip extensions. Examples are the single-shot Pardini K22 Longarm[50] and the Westlake Britarms Long Pistol, a permitted .22 LR five-shot semi-automatic pistol.[51]Northern Ireland[edit]More than 100,000 people in Northern Ireland (approximately 5.7% of the population) own firearms, having 380,000 among them.[52] Gun control laws in Northern Ireland are less restrictive in some areas than gun laws in Great Britain due to the Good Friday Agreement, allowing Northern Ireland to govern itself and pass less restrictive laws. Gun laws in Northern Ireland are primarily affected by the Firearms (Northern Ireland) Order 2004. Any firearm that has a muzzle energy exceeding 1 joule must be listed on a firearms certificate. Northern Ireland has one firearms certificate and all firearms are listed on that certificate irrespective of type.All firearms owners in Northern Ireland are required to apply for a firearm certificate to possess firearms. Permits are issued to anyone who has good reason to possess firearms, such as target shooting and hunting. All firearms certificate holders are required to demonstrate they can be entrusted with a firearm. It is recommended that firearms dealers selling firearms are to instruct new buyers, and those changing/acquiring another firearm, about the safety procedures for that firearm. Firearm certificate holders in Northern Ireland may transport their firearms (except handguns) to Great Britain and possess those firearms while in Great Britain due to reciprocal firearms certificate licensing arrangements.Firearms certificate holders are limited to the number of rounds of each calibre of ammunition listed on their certificate to 1000 per listed calibre. This is a standard allowance given to every certificate holder. If a certificate holder requires a larger allowance, they must request that increase from PSNI Firearms Branch.Semi-automatic rifles are permitted when chambered in .22 rimfire. Handguns, shotguns and air rifles are permitted in various calibres. There is currently no limit on magazine capacity for rifles or handguns. Shotguns are limited to a magazine capacity of 2 cartridges for field use. The shotgun capacity can be increased, upon application to the PSNI firearms branch, for target shooting use.Magazines are considered a component part in Northern Ireland and a firearms certificate holder may only possess magazines for firearms listed on their certificate. As of 2021, all magazines are required to be listed on firearms certificates. This measure is PSNI Firearms Branch policy in line with the recent EU weapons directive. PSNI Firearms Branch are to clarify exactly how this will take place.A firearm certificate for a personal protection weapon will only be authorised where the Police Service of Northern Ireland deems there is a ""verifiable specific risk"" to the life of an individual and that the possession of a firearm is a reasonable, proportionate and necessary measure to protect their life.[53] Permits for personal protection also allow the holder to carry their firearms concealed.[citation needed] Northern Ireland is the only part of the United Kingdom where personal protection is accepted as a legitimate reason to obtain and own a firearm.Scotland[edit]Firearms laws in Scotland differ in some details from those in England and Wales, such as a licence being required to own most air guns. However, in terms of licensing they are, currently, identical to England and Wales.[dubious ] A firearms certificate is required to purchase firearms,[54] and a separate shotgun certificate is required for shotguns.[55] The guiding laws for firearms in Scotland are the Firearms (Scotland) Rules 1989 and the Firearms Act (1968). All handguns, semi-automatic and pump-action non-rim-fire rifles are prohibited. A few pistols are licensed on a Firearm Certificate for exactly the same reasons as England and Wales. There are only 566 licensed handgun owners in Scotland.[56]Air weapon licensing[edit]In 2006, Glasgow politician Tommy Sheridan of the political party Solidarity launched a consultation to restrict possession of air guns, highlighting recent cases including the death of toddler Andrew Morton but the Scottish Parliament did not have the power to ban airguns at the time so any measures would have needed to be formally approved by Westminster.[57] Around this time, the media gave some exposure to growing public desire to have air guns banned or regulated, particularly from the parents of a child that died after being struck in the head by a pellet in Easterhouse,[58] a suburb of east Glasgow.[59] The child was said to have had a skull only two millimetres thick at the point of impact.[60]MSPs such as Kenny MacAskill have claimed Scotland has a problem with air gun violence. However official figures show that out of the estimated 500,000 airguns in Scotland there were only 195 offences a ratio of less than 0.04%. Not all of these offences have been linked to violence with many being minor.[61]The Commission on Scottish Devolution when implemented gave the Scottish Parliament powers to regulate air guns. On 14 December 2012, a consultation was launched to investigate proposals for licensing air weapons in Scotland. The Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Justice foreword in the consultation paper (titled Proposals for Licensing Air Weapons in Scotland[62]) stated that the Scottish government ""[does] not intend to ban air weapons outright, but [does] not think that it is appropriate in our modern Scotland that there can be up to half a million unregistered, uncontrolled and often forgotten firearms (however, air weapons are not considered \'firearms\' under the law[44] ) in circulation"". It stated an aim to ""ensure that only those people with a legitimate reason for owning and using an airgun should have access to them in the future, and that they are properly licensed and accounted for"". In 2011/12 there were 195 offences involving air weapons in Scotland, compared to 3,554 in England and Wales.[63] The consultation closed in March 2013 with 1,101 responses, 87% of which were opposed to the principle of licensing air weapons.[64]As of 31 December 2016, it is a requirement to hold an airgun certificate in Scotland to possess an air rifle with muzzle energy less than 12 ft⋅lb (16 J) or air pistol with muzzle energy less than 6 ft⋅lb (8.1 J). There are some exceptions for current FAC and SGC holders in that they may hold an air rifle on their current certificate and apply to add it/them when next renewing their FAC or SGC.[65]History of firearms legislation in the United Kingdom[edit]Many laws and amendments governing possession and use of firearms have been enacted over the years; see Firearms Act § United Kingdom for a more complete list.Following the assassination of William the Silent in 1584 with a concealed wheellock pistol, Queen Elizabeth I, fearing assassination by Roman Catholics, banned possession of wheellock pistols in England near a royal palace in 1594.[66]There were growing concerns in the 16th century over the use of guns and crossbows. Four acts were imposed to restrict their use in England and Wales.[67]The 1662 Act for ordering the Forces in the several Counties of the Kingdom[a] enabled and authorized by warrant, local government personnel, to search for and seize all arms in the custody or possession of any person of persons whom the government judged dangerous to the peace of the kingdom. It prohibited the search of rural houses during the night hours. It made it lawful in case of resistance to enter by force. Furthermore, it allowed for the restoration of seized arms.[68]The Bill of Rights restated the ancient rights of the people to bear arms by reinstating the right of Protestants to have arms after they had been disarmed by James II. It follows closely the Declaration of Rights made in Parliament in February 1689.[69] The Bill of Rights text declares that ""the Subjects which are Protestants may have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions and as allowed by Law"".[70]Whereas the late King James the Second, by the Assistance of divers evil Counsellors, Judges, and Ministers, employed by Him, did endeavour to subvert and extirpate the Protestant Religion, and the Laws and Liberties of this Kingdom ... (b)y assuming and exercising a Power of dispensing with and suspending of Laws, and the Execution of Laws, without Consent of Parliament ... (b)y causing several good Subjects, being Protestants, to be disarmed, at the same Time when Papists were both armed and employed contrary to Law ... (a)ll which are utterly and directly contrary to the known Laws and Statutes and Freedom of this Realm ... the said Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons, pursuant to their respective Letters and Elections, being now assembled in a full and free Representative of this Nation, taking into their most serious Consideration the best Means for attaining the Ends aforesaid, do in the First Place (as their Ancestors in like Case have usually done), for the vindicating and asserting their ancient Rights and Liberties, Declare, ... That the Subjects which are Protestants may have Arms for their Defence, suitable to their Condition, and as allowed by Law.The rights of English subjects and, after 1707, British subjects, to possess arms was recognised under English common law. Sir William Blackstone\'s Commentaries on the Laws of England, were highly influential and were used as a reference and text book for English Common Law. In his Commentaries, Blackstone described the right to arms.[71]The fifth and last auxiliary right of the subject, that I shall at present mention, is that of having arms for their defence, suitable to their condition and degree, and such as are allowed by law. Which is also declared by the same statute I W. & M. st.2. c.2. and is indeed a public allowance, under due restrictions, of the natural right of resistance and self-preservation, when the sanctions of society and laws are found insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression.Formerly, this same British common law applied to the UK and Australia, and until 1783 to the colonies in North America that became the United States. The right to keep and bear arms had originated in England during the reign of Henry II with the 1181 Assize of Arms, and developed as part of common law.After the Jacobite rebellions of 1715 and 1745, harsh laws providing, amongst other things, for disarming the Highlands of Scotland, were enacted by the Parliament of Great Britain: the Disarming Acts of 1716 and 1725, and the Act of Proscription 1746.The first British firearm controls were introduced as part of the Vagrancy Act 1824, which was set up in a reaction against the large number of people roaming the country with weapons brought back from the Napoleonic wars. It allowed the police to arrest ""any person with any gun, pistol, hanger [a light sword], cutlass, bludgeon or other offensive weapon ... with intent to commit a felonious act"". It was followed by the Night Poaching Acts 1828 and 1844, the Game Act 1831, and the Poaching Prevention Act 1862, which made it an offence to shoot game illegally by using a firearm.The Gun Licence Act 1870 was created to raise revenue. It required a person to obtain a licence to carry a gun outside his own property for any reason. A licence was not required to buy a gun. The licences cost 10 shillings (equivalent to about £31 in 2005), lasted one year and could be bought over the counter at Post Offices.Pistols Act 1903[edit]The Pistols Act 1903 was the first to place restrictions on the sale of firearms. Titled ""An Act to regulate the sale and use of Pistols or other Firearms"", it was short, with just nine sections, and applied solely to pistols. It defined a pistol as a firearm whose barrel did not exceed 9 in (230 mm) in length and made it illegal to sell or rent a pistol to anyone who could not produce a current gun licence or game licence, unless they were exempt from the Gun Licence Act, could prove that they planned to use the pistol on their own property, or had a statement signed by a police officer of inspector rank or above or a Justice of the Peace to the effect that they were about to go abroad for six months or more. The Act was more or less ineffective, as anyone wishing to buy a pistol commercially merely had to purchase a licence on demand over the counter from a Post Office before doing so. In addition, it did not regulate private sales of such firearms.The legislators laid some emphasis on the dangers of pistols in the hands of children and drunkards and made specific provisions regarding sales to these two groups: persons under 18 could be fined 40 shillings if they bought, hired, or carried a pistol, while anyone who sold a pistol to such a person could be fined £5. Anyone who sold a pistol to someone who was ""intoxicated or of unsound mind"" was liable to a fine of £25 or 3 months\' imprisonment with hard labour. However, it was not an offence under the Act to give or lend a pistol to anyone belonging to the two groups.[72]Firearms Act 1920[edit]The Firearms Act 1920 was partly spurred by fears of a possible surge in crime from the large number of firearms available following World War I and also fears of working-class unrest in this period. ""An Act to amend the law relating to firearms and other weapons and ammunition"", its main stated aim was to enable the government to control the overseas arms trade and so fulfill its commitment to the 1919 Paris Arms Convention.[73] The ongoing Anglo-Irish War may also have been a factor, as Britain and Ireland were at that time still in union with each other, and the Act also applied to Ireland. It required anyone wanting to purchase or possess a firearm or ammunition to obtain a firearm certificate. The certificate, which lasted for three years, specified not only the firearm but also the amount of ammunition the holder could buy or possess. Local chief constables decided who could obtain a certificate and had the power to exclude anyone of ""intemperate habits"" or ""unsound mind"", or anyone considered ""for any reason unfitted to be trusted with firearms"". Applicants for certificates also had to convince the police that they had a good reason for needing a certificate. The law did not affect smooth-bore guns, which were available for purchase without any form of paperwork. The penalty for violating the Act was a fine of up to £50 or ""imprisonment with or without hard labour for a term not exceeding three months"", or both.[74]The right of individuals to bear arms had previously been, in the words of the 1689 Bill of Rights, ""as allowed by law"". The 1920 Act made this right conditional upon the Home Secretary and the police. A series of classified Home Office directives defined for the benefit of chief constables what constituted good reason to grant a certificate. They originally included self-defence.[74]As the 1920 Act did not prevent criminals from obtaining firearms illegally, in 1933 the Firearms and Imitation Firearms (Criminal Use) Bill was submitted to Parliament. It increased the punishment for the use of a gun in the commission of a crime and made it an offence punishable by up to 14 years\' imprisonment for anyone to ""attempt to make use"" of any firearm or imitation firearm to resist arrest. Possession of a real or imitation firearm was also made an offence unless the possessor could show he had it for ""a lawful object"".[75]Firearms Act 1937[edit]The Firearms Act 1937 incorporated various modifications to the 1920 Act based on the recommendations of a 1934 committee chaired by Sir Archibald Bodkin. The resulting legislation raised the minimum age for buying a firearm or airgun from 14 to 17, extended controls to shotguns and other smooth-bore weapons with barrels shorter than 20 in (510 mm) (later raised by the Firearms Act 1968 to 24 in (610 mm)), transferred certificates for machine guns to military oversight, regulated gun dealers, and granted chief constables the power to add conditions to individual Firearms Certificates.[76]The same year, the Home Secretary ruled that self-defence was no longer a suitable reason for applying for a firearm certificate and directed police to refuse such applications on the grounds that ""firearms cannot be regarded as a suitable means of protection and may be a source of danger"".[77]Firearms Act 1968[edit]The Firearms Act 1968 brought together all existing firearms legislation in a single statute. Disregarding minor changes, it formed the legal basis for British firearms control policy until the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 was put through Parliament in the aftermath of the 1987 Hungerford massacre. For the first time, it introduced controls for long-barrelled shotguns, in the form of Shotgun Certificates that, like Firearm Certificates, were issued by an area\'s chief constable in England, Scotland, and Wales. While applicants for Firearms Certificates had to show a good reason for possessing the firearm or ammunition, it did not apply to Shotgun Certificates. Firearms and ammunition had to be kept locked up in a secure place approved by the local police firearms officer.The Act also prohibited the possession of firearms or ammunition by criminals who had been sentenced to imprisonment; those sentenced to three months to three years imprisonment were banned from possessing firearms or ammunition for five years, while those sentenced to longer terms were banned for life. However, an application could be made to have the prohibition removed.[78]The Act was accompanied by an amnesty; many older weapons were handed in to the police. It has remained a feature of British policing that from time to time a brief firearms amnesty is declared.[79]The Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988[edit]In the aftermath of the Hungerford massacre, Parliament passed the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988.[80] This confined semi-automatic and pump-action centre-fire rifles, military weapons firing explosive ammunition, short shotguns that had magazines, and elevated both pump-action and self-loading rifles to the Prohibited category.[81] Registration and secure storage of shotguns held on Shotgun Certificates became required, and shotguns with more than a 2+1 capacity came to need a Firearm Certificate. The law also introduced new restrictions on shotguns. Rifles in .22 rimfire and semi-automatic pistols were unaffected.1997 Firearms (Amendment) Acts[edit]Following the Dunblane massacre, the government passed the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 and the Firearms (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1997, defining ""short firearms"" as Section 5 Prohibited Weapons, which effectively banned private possession of handguns almost completely in Great Britain. Exceptions to the ban include muzzle-loading guns, pistols of historic interest (such as pistols used in notable crimes, rare prototypes, unusual serial numbers, guns forming part of a collection), guns used for starting sporting events, signal pistols, pistols that are of particular aesthetic interest (such as engraved or jewelled guns) and shot pistols for pest control. Even the UK\'s Olympic shooters fell under this ban; shooters could only train in Northern Ireland (where the ban did not apply), or outside of the UK, be that in the Crown Dependencies (made up of the Channel Islands and Isle of Man), or in foreign nations (in Switzerland, in practice).[82] Prior to the 2012 London Olympics, British Shooting negotiated an agreement with the Home Office to issue Section 5 Permits to a limited number of nominated elite athletes, allowing them to keep pistols and train on the UK Mainland at nominated ""Section 5 Ranges"". This agreement was renewed following the Olympics and Section 5 Permits remain on issue for eligible members of the GB Squad.162,000 pistols and 700 tons of ammunition and related equipment were handed in by an estimated 57,000 people – 0.1% of the population, or one in every 960 persons.[83] At the time, the renewal cycle for FACs was five years, meaning that it would take six years for the full reduction of valid certificates for both large-calibre and .22 handguns bans (because certificates remained valid even if the holder had disposed of all their firearms). On 31 December 1996, prior to the large-calibre handgun ban, there were 133,600 FACs on issue in England and Wales; by 31 December 1997 it had fallen to 131,900. On 31 December 2001, five years after the large calibre ban, the number had fallen to 119,600 and 117,700 the following year.[37] This represents a net drop of 24,200 certificates. Comparable figures for Scotland show a net drop of 5,841 from 32,053 to 26,212 certificates,[84] making a GB total net drop of 30,041. However, while the number of certificates in England and Wales rose each year after 2002 to stand at 126,400 at 31 March 2005 (due to a change in reporting period), those in Scotland remained relatively static, standing at 26,538 at 31 December 2005.Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006[edit]This Act mainly impacted upon firearms legislation by creating minimum sentences for some firearms offences,[85] regulating the sale of primers and provisions relating to imitation firearms.[86] From 6 April 2007 the sale and transfer of new ""air weapons"" by mail order (""by way of trade or business"") became an offence (they may still be purchased in person), as well as the sale of primers, and realistic imitation firearms (RIFs). The only exceptions are for the purposes of military and historical reenactment, media and theatre production, paintballing, and Airsoft as a sport. This has affected Airsoft in the UK by restricting the sale, import and purchase of airsoft replicas to individuals entitled to a specific defence, e.g. members of an organised airsoft site holding permitted activities with third-party liability insurance cover or re-enactors.The 2012 Olympics[edit]Following the awarding of the 2012 Olympic Games to London, the government announced that special dispensation would be granted to allow the various shooting events to be held, as had been the case previously for the 2002 Commonwealth Games. Further dispensations allowed foreign participants in shooting events to train in the UK, even though it remained illegal for native pistol shooters to train in England, Scotland or Wales.[87]Controversially, shooting events for the Games were held at temporary facilities at the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich, with the cost of £42 million including their subsequent demolition. Shooting sports bodies and some politicians argued that the money would have been better spent on the lasting legacy that would be gained by refurbishing and upgrading permanent facilities at the National Shooting Centre at Bisley, which would have cost a maximum of £30 million.[88][89][90]Offensive Weapons Act 2019[edit]At the Bill stage, this Act proposed to amend Section 5 (Prohibited Weapons) of the 1968 act with three new classes:- Bump stocks.- ""Rapid Firing"" MARS and Lever-release rifles (not to be confused with lever action rifles, which remain legal).[91]- ""High Muzzle Energy"" firearms generating more than 10,000ft/lb muzzle energy.The prohibition on bump stocks was a reaction to the 2017 Las Vegas shooting. This had no effect on the UK legal market as most semi-automatic firearms are already prohibited and bump stocks were not commonly available. It was intended to prevent the import of such items for use with illicit firearms.MARS and Lever release firearms were moved to s5 due to a perception that they represented a ""loophole"" around the prohibition on semi-automatic rifles and could ""fire rapidly"". A scheme to compensate owners opened in December 2020, ahead of the prohibition coming into force in March 2021.[92][91]The final item for consideration were high muzzle energy firearms. This was intended to target rifles in .50BMG calibre that were ""capable of 10,000 foot pounds of muzzle energy"". However, this criteria would also apply to some British hunting calibres. This proposal never made the final Act.There were several proposed amendments to include further restrictions on all firearms and the licensing of airguns in England and Wales, none of which were adopted. Air weapons and high muzzle energy firearms were also part of a public consultation in December 2020.[93] The outcome of the consultation was published in July 2022.[94]Crime[edit]The UK has one of the lowest rates of gun homicides in the world.[95] There were 0.05 recorded intentional homicides committed with a firearm per 100,000 inhabitants in the five years to 2011 (15 to 38 people per year). Gun homicides accounted for 2.4% of all homicides in the year 2011.[96] Office for National Statistics figures show 7,866 offences in which firearms were involved in the year ending March 2015, 2% up on the previous year and the first increase in 10 years. Of these, 19 were fatalities, 10 fewer than the previous year and the lowest since records began in 1969.[97]Operation Viper[edit]An operation against illegal firearms and ammunition by the Metropolitan Police of London started in 2016 and continuing as of 2022[update] was named ""Operation Viper"".[98][99]Spree killings and mass shootings[edit]Britain has had few spree killings or mass shootings. The most well known are the Hungerford massacre of 1987, the Dunblane school massacre of 1996, and the Cumbria shootings of 2010. After Hungerford and Dunblane, firearms legislation was amended, tightening firearms restrictions in the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom Gun legislation has been described by The Huffington Post as ""one of the toughest regimes in the world.""[100] After Hungerford, the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 criminalised most semi-automatic long-barrelled weapons; it was generally supported by the Labour opposition although some Labour backbenchers thought it inadequate.[101] After the second incident, the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 criminalised private possession of most handguns having a calibre over .22; the Snowdrop Campaign continued to press for a wider ban, and in 1997 the incoming Labour government passed the Firearms (Amendment) (No. 2) Act. This extended the ban to most handguns with a calibre of .22, excepting antique handguns and black-powder revolvers.Hungerford massacre[edit]On 19 August 1987, 27-year-old Michael Ryan, armed with two semi-automatic rifles (a Type 56 sporter and an M1 carbine) and a Beretta 92 pistol, dressed in combat fatigues and proceeded around the town of Hungerford killing 16 people, wounding 15 and shooting himself, in what became known as the Hungerford massacre. Ryan\'s collection of weapons had been legally licensed, according to the Hungerford Report.Dunblane massacre[edit]On 13 March 1996, Thomas Hamilton, a 43-year-old former scout leader who had been ousted by The Scout Association in 1974, shot dead 16 young children and their teacher, Gweneth Mayor, in Dunblane Primary School\'s gymnasium with two Browning Hi-Power pistols and two Smith & Wesson Model 19 revolvers. He then shot himself.[102] There is a memorial to the 17 victims in the local cemetery and a cenotaph in the cathedral. The funds raised in the aftermath of the tragedy have been used to build a new community centre for the town.Personnel of the Police Firearms Licensing Office were unaware of Hamilton\'s expulsion by the Scout Association, nor were they aware of allegations made against him regarding unsavoury behaviour on a number of boy\'s summer camps he had organised, allegations that would have exposed his poor character. The tragedy led to improvements in inter-departmental sharing of police intelligence and deeper background checks of firearm certificate applicants.After the incident, legislation was introduced in 1997 to prohibit, with some extremely specialised exemptions, ""small firearms"" with a barrel length of less than 30 cm (12 in) or an overall length of less than 60 cm (24 in).Cumbria shootings[edit]On 2 June 2010, Derrick Bird, a 52-year-old taxi driver, shot and killed 12 people and injured 11 others while driving through Cumbria. He then shot himself. Bird was a licensed firearms holder; his weapons were a 12-gauge double-barrelled shotgun and CZ 452-2E ZKM .22-calibre bolt-action rifle.[103]Plymouth shootings[edit]On 12 August 2021, 22-year-old Jake Davison, an apprentice crane operator and bodybuilding enthusiast, shot seven people, killing five including his own mother, around a residential area in the Keyham area of Plymouth in Devon. He then shot and killed himself. Davison\'s motives were related to his declining mental health and quality of life.[104] Davison considered himself to be a part of the incel movement, blaming others for his issues and hardships and would regularly vent his frustrations online.[104] Prior to carrying out the attack, Davison posted a video rant, saying how he was ""beaten down"".[105]Davison was armed with an unspecified shotgun which he held legally on a shotgun certificate. An investigation into the events that transpired during this incident quickly revealed that Davison had previously lost his shotgun certificate after admitting to assaulting two youths at a park. He then had his firearm and firearm license reinstated after participating in a Pathfinder programme.[106]The incident prompted the Home Office to review how firearms certificates and shotgun certificates were issued and which amendments to make to ensure people who are in a similar disposition to Davison cannot gain access to firearms.This was the first mass shooting in the United Kingdom to happen since the Cumbria shooting.See also[edit]- Armed response vehicle- Firearms Enquiries Officer- Gun politics- Gun safe- List of massacres in Great Britain- Lobbying in the United Kingdom- Police use of firearms in the United KingdomExplanatory notes[edit]- ^ City of London Militia Act 1662 (14 Cha. 2) c.3Citations[edit]- ^ Casciani, Dominic (2 November 2010).

Subject to licensing, members of the public may own rifles and shotguns. However, most handguns have been banned in Great Britain since the Dunblane school massacre in 1996. Handguns are permitted in Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man which have their own legislation. Scotland imposes an additional licensing regime on airguns, which is not mirrored in England and Wales.\n\nMass shootings are extremely rare. There have only been five major shootings carried out by a civilian in British history: the 1987 Hungerford massacre; 1989 Monkseaton shootings; the 1996 Dunblane massacre; the 2010 Cumbria shootings and the 2021 Plymouth shooting. Concerns are raised periodically over the availability of illegal firearms.\n\nSummary\nFully automatic and submachine-guns are ""prohibited weapons"" and require explicit permission from central government to own. Generally, such permits are not made available to private citizens. Semi-automatic rifles over .22 in (5.6 mm) and pistols are similarly ""prohibited"", although there are exceptions for pistols for use for the humane dispatch of animals (classed under section 5). There are also limited exceptions permitting pistols both to preserve firearms of historic or technical interest (classed as section 7 firearms) and to enable use by elite sports teams. Semi-automatic shotguns are restricted to a magazine capacity of no more than two shots and are held under Section 2 of the Firearms Act, although a \'multi-shot\' shotgun can be owned under section 1 (restricted firearms and ammunition) of the Firearms Act. Where the term \'multi-shot\' is used, this refers to either a semi-automatic or pump-action shotgun with no restriction on magazine capacity. All other rifles and their ammunition are permitted with no limits as to magazine size, for permitted purposes, to include: target shooting, hunting, and historic and muzzle-loading weapons, as well as long-barrelled breech-loading pistols with a specific overall length, but not for self-defence since 1968; however if a home-owner is threatened they may be used in self-defence, so long as the force is reasonable. Shotgun possession and use is also controlled, and even low-power air rifles and pistols, while permitted, are controlled to some extent. A Firearm Certificate issued by the police is required for all weapons and ammunition except air weapons of modest power (of muzzle energy not over 12 ft⋅lbf (16 J) for rifles, and 6 ft⋅lbf (8.1 J) for pistols). Shotguns with a capacity of three rounds or less (up to guns with a magazine holding no more than two rounds, in addition to one in the chamber) are subject to less stringent licensing requirements than other firearms and require a Shotgun Certificate; shotguns with higher capacity require a Firearm Certificate.\n\nPossession of live ammunition without an appropriate licence, or failure to store ammunition securely can lead to severe penalties. Ammunition for firearms may only be purchased and possessed by the holder of a Firearm Certificate relating to firearm capable of shooting that specific ammunition. Shotgun cartridges can legally be possessed by anybody over the age of 15 and no licence is required to possess such ammunition so long as the cartridges contain 5 or more shots. However, a Shotgun Certificate must still be shown at time of purchase.\n\nWhile Scotland has had its own parliament (Holyrood) since the Scotland Act 1998, power to legislate on firearms was reserved to Westminster, which led to tensions between the British and Scottish parliaments, with the Scottish government wanting to enact stricter laws.\nIn Northern Ireland, firearms control laws are primarily regulated by the Firearms (Northern Ireland) Order 2004, which is slightly different from the law in Great Britain.\nLegal classification\nRifles\nUK law defines a ""rifle"" as a rifled firearm with a barrel longer than 30 cm (12 in), and a total length longer than 60 cm (24 in). Single-shot, bolt-action, Martini-action, lever-action (also called under-lever action) and revolver rifles and carbines are permitted, with certificate, in any calibre. Self-loading (also known as semi-automatic) or pump-action rifles are only permitted in .22 rimfire calibre.\n\nPistols\nThe 1997 law did not ban pistols as such and was drafted in terms of small firearms. British law defines a ""pistol"" as a firearm with a barrel shorter than 30 cm (12 in) or a total length of less than 60 cm (24 in) (this definition encompasses revolvers, revolving pistols). Only muzzle-loading pistols—including muzzle-loading revolvers—are permitted; in practice all such firearms use black powder—a Class 1 explosive—as the propellant. Small quantities of muzzle-loading pistols and revolvers in various calibres, which comply with the regulations, are manufactured. All other pistols are mostly prohibited in Great Britain, with some exceptions such as pistols used for the humane dispatch of injured animals (such as deer) and some historical firearms.\n\nThis law created a new market for ""long-barrelled revolvers"" and ""long-barrelled pistols"", firearms with a permanently attached extension to the grip, making them long enough to fit under the legal definition of a rifle. Long-barrelled pistols in single-shot, or long-barrelled revolvers, both of any calibre, or semi-automatic in .22 rimfire, are all permitted with a Firearm Certificate.\n\nSpecific models of blank-firing starting pistol that are ""readily convertible"" to fire live ammunition may also be either banned or require a Firearm Certificate. The Bruni Olympic .380 BBM blank-firing revolver was banned in 2010 on evidence that it was being illegally converted.\n\nShotguns\nSingle-, double-, or triple-barrelled shotguns, or those with a lever-action, pump-action, or semi-automatic action and fixed magazine capacity of no more than 2 cartridges are permitted on a Shotgun Certificate as long as they meet the criteria of having a minimum barrel length of 24"", overall length of 40"", and a non-detachable magazine (if present). There\'s no limit on the number of guns or amount of ammunition that a Shotgun Certificate holder can acquire or possess at one time, although each shotgun must be recorded on the certificates. Cartridges obtained using a Shotgun Certificate must have at least 5 projectiles each with a maximum size of 0.36"". Other types of shotgun ammunition such as solid slugs can only be bought following the grant of an Firearm Certificate. Shotguns with a detachable magazine or larger fixed magazine are considered firearms and require a Section 1 Firearm Certificate (24"" rule and 40"" fixed overall length) or break action shotguns with a minimum 12"" barrel and overall 24"" fixed length.\n\nAirguns\nAirguns are firearms like any other according to the definition given in the Firearms Act 1968 at section 57(1). However, with the exception of Scotland where a certificate is now required, they are exempt from the requirement that a Firearm Certificate or Shotgun Certificate need be obtained to possess or acquire them provided that they meet certain limits as to their power. Air pistols with a muzzle energy not exceeding 6 foot-pounds force (8.1 joules) and other airguns with muzzle energy not exceeding 12 ft⋅lbf (16 J) do not require a certificate and may be acquired, purchased and possessed by anyone over the age of 18 and who is not a prohibited person as specified in section 21 of the Act which relates to persons previously convicted of a crime. The UK Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006 controls online or mail-order sales of airguns.\n\n'}
 {'raw_text': 'Right to keep and bear armsThis article\'s lead section may be too short to adequately summarize the key points. (May 2022)The right to keep and bear arms (often referred to as the right to bear arms) is a right for people to possess weapons (arms) for the preservation of life, liberty, and property.[1] The purpose of gun rights is for self-defense, including security against tyranny, as well as hunting and sporting activities.[2]: 96 [3] Countries that guarantee the right to keep and bear arms include the Czech Republic, Guatemala, Ukraine, Mexico, the Philippines, the United States, Yemen, and Switzerland.Background[edit]The Bill of Rights 1689 allowed Protestant citizens of England to ""have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions and as allowed by Law"" and restricted the ability of the English Crown to have a standing army or to interfere with Protestants\' right to bear arms ""when Papists were both Armed and Imployed contrary to Law"" and established that Parliament, not the Crown, could regulate the right to bear arms.[4][5]Sir William Blackstone wrote in the 18th century that the right to have arms was auxiliary to the ""natural right of resistance and self-preservation"" subject to suitability and allowance by law.[6] The term arms, as used in the 1600s, refers to the process of equipping for war.[7] It is commonly used as a synonym for weapon.[8]Inclusion of this right in a written constitution is uncommon. In 1875, 17 percent of national constitutions included a right to bear arms. Since the early twentieth century, ""the proportion has been less than 9 percent and falling"".[9] In an article titled ""U.S. Gun Rights Truly Are American Exceptionalism,"" a historical survey and comparative analysis of constitutions dating back to 1789,[9] Tom Ginsburg and colleagues ""identified only 15 constitutions (in nine countries) that had ever included an explicit right to bear arms. Almost all of these constitutions have been in Latin America, and most were from the 19th century"".[10]Countries recognizing the right to keep and bear arms[edit]America[edit]Guatemala[edit]The right to own weapons for personal use, not prohibited by the law, in the place of inhabitation, is recognized. There will not be an obligation to hand them over, except in cases ordered by a competent judge.[11]Article 38 of Guatemala ConstitutionWhile protecting the right to keep arms, Guatemalan constitution specifies that this right extends only to ""weapons not prohibited by law"".Honduras[edit]Every person, in the exercise of their civil rights, may request a maximum of five (5) license for the possession and carrying of up to five (5) firearms by submitting an application with the following information[12](...)(1) Form with personal information and residence; (2) Brand, model, serial number, identification of modification of calibre, if any; as well as any other characteristics of the weapon; (3) Proof of having undertaken a ballistic test; (4) Payment of municipal matriculation and criminal background check; and, (5) Identification documents.Article 27 of Decree No. 69-2007, Modifying the Act on the Control of Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives and Other Related MaterialsThe constitution of Honduras does not protect the right to keep and bear arms.Although not explicitly mentioned in the legislation, every person is entitled to receive a license to keep and carry arms by Honduran Statute law, provided that they fulfill the conditions required by the law.[13]Mexico[edit]The inhabitants of the United Mexican States have the right to possess arms within their domicile, for their safety and legitimate defense, except those forbidden by Federal Law and those reserved for the exclusive use of the Army, Militia, Air Force and National Guard. Federal law shall provide in what cases, conditions, under what requirements and in which places inhabitants shall be authorized to bear arms.[14]Article 10 of Mexican ConstitutionThe Mexican constitution of 1857 first included the right to be armed. In its first version, the right was defined in similar terms as it is in the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution. A new Mexican constitution of 1917 relativized the right, stating that its utilization must be in line with local police regulations.Another change was included in 1917 Constitution. Since then, Mexicans have the right to be armed only within their home and further utilization of this right is subject to statutory authorization in Federal law.United States[edit]A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.[15]In the United States, which has an English common law tradition, a longstanding common-law right to keep and bear arms was practiced prior to the creation of a written national constitution.[16] Today, this right is specifically protected by the United States Constitution and many state constitutions. [17]Europe[edit]Czech Republic[edit]The right to acquire, keep and bear firearms is guaranteed under conditions set by this law.Article 1 Subsection 1 of Czech Firearms Act(1) Everyone has the right to life. Human life is worthy of protection even before birth.(2) Nobody may be deprived of their life.(3) The death penalty is prohibited.(4) Deprivation of life is not inflicted in contravention of this Article if it occurs in connection with conduct which is not criminal under the law. The right to defend own life or life of another person also with arms is guaranteed under conditions set out in the law.[18]Constitutional amendment of Czech Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms passed in 2021. Most of the Article is preexisting, the last sentence in subsection 4 was newly added.Historically, the Czech lands were at the forefront of the spreading of civilian firearms ownership.[19] In the 1420s and 1430s, firearms became indispensable tools for the mostly peasant Hussite armies whose amateur combatants, including women, fended off a series of invasions of professional crusader armies of well-armored warriors with cold weapons.[19] Throughout and after the Hussite wars, firearms\' design underwent fast development and their possession by civilians became a matter of course.[19]Their first firearms regulation was enacted in 1517 as a part of general accord between the nobles and burghers and later in 1524 as a standalone Enactment on Firearms (zřízení o ručnicích). The 1517 law explicitly stated that ""all people of all standing have the right to keep firearms at home"" while at the same time enacting a universal carry ban.[19] The 1524 enactment set out a process of issuing of permits for carrying of firearms and detailed enforcement and punishment for carrying without such a permit.[19] Carrying later became permitless again until 1852, when Imperial Regulation No. 223 reintroduced carry permits. This law remained in force until the 1939 German invasion.[19]Since its inception during the Hussite revolution, the right to keep firearms endured over five-hundred years until the Nazi gun ban during the German occupation in the 20th century. Firearms possession later became subject to government permission during the communist dictatorship with only those deemed loyal to the communist party being able to be armed. After the return of liberty, the Czech Republic instated a shall issue permitting process, under which all residents can keep and bear arms subject to the fulfillment of regulatory conditions.[19]In the Czech Republic, every resident that meets conditions laid down in Act No. 119/2002 Coll.[20] has the right to have a firearms license issued and can then obtain a firearm.[21][22] Holders of D (exercise of profession) and E (self-defense) licenses, which are also shall-issue, can carry up to two concealed firearms for protection.[23] The right to be armed is statutorily protected.A proposal to have right to keep and bear arms included in the constitution was entered in the Czech Parliament in December 2016.[24] The proposal was approved by vote of 139 to 9 on 28 June 2017 by the Chamber of Deputies. It later failed to reach necessary support in Senate, where only 28 out of 59 Senators present supported it (with constitutional majority being 36 votes).[25] A new proposal was entered by 35 Senators in September 2019[26] and then approved on 21 July 2021, adding a new sentence, according to which ""the right to defend one\'s own life or the life of another person even with the use of a weapon is guaranteed under the conditions set by the law.""[27]Switzerland[edit]The right to acquire, keep and bear arms is guaranteed within boundaries of this law.Article 3 of Swiss Firearms ActThe Swiss have a statutory right to bear arms under Article 3 of the 1997 Weapons Act.[28][a] Switzerland practices universal conscription, which requires that all able-bodied male citizens keep fully automatic firearms at home in case of a call-up. Each male between the ages of 20 and 34 is considered a candidate for conscription into the military, and following a brief period of active duty will commonly be enrolled in the militia until age or an inability to serve ends his obligation.[29] Until December 2009, these men were required to keep their government-issued selective fire combat rifles and semi-automatic handguns in their homes as long as they were enrolled in the armed forces.[30] Since January 2010, they have had the option of depositing their personal firearm at a government arsenal.[31] Until September 2007, soldiers received 50 rounds of government-issued ammunition in a sealed box for storage at home; after 2007 only about 2,000 specialist troops are allowed to keep the ammunition at home.[32]In a referendum in February 2011, voters rejected a citizens\' initiative that would have obliged members of the armed services to store their rifles and pistols on military compounds and required that privately owned firearms be registered.[33]United Kingdom[edit]That the Subjects which are Protestants may have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions and as allowed by Law.Bill of Rights 1689In the United Kingdom, there is no automatic right to bear arms,[34] although citizens may possess certain firearms on obtaining an appropriate licence.[35] Ordinary members of the public may own sporting rifles and shotguns, subject to licensing, while handguns, automatic, and centerfire semi-automatic weapons are illegal to possess without special additional conditions.[34][36] When not attended, all licensed firearms must be stored securely (locked) and separate from their ammunition. Regulations for airguns are less stringent and air pistols with a muzzle energy not exceeding 6 foot-pounds force (8.1 joules) and other airguns with a muzzle energy not exceeding 12 ft⋅lbf (16 J) do not require any certificates or licensing, although the same storage requirement applies. The first serious control on firearms was established with the passing of the Firearms Act 1920,[37] handgun restrictions being added in response to the 1996 Dunblane Massacre in which 18 people died.Historically the English Bill of Rights 1689 allowed:That the Subjects which are Protestants may have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions and as allowed by Law.[38]Since 1953, it has been a criminal offence in the United Kingdom to carry a knife (with the exception of non-locking folding knives with a cutting edge of 3 inches (7.62 centimetres) or less) or any ""offensive weapon"" in a public place without lawful authority (e.g. police or security forces) or reasonable excuse (e.g. tools that are needed for work). The cutting edge of a knife is separate to the blade length. The only manner in which an individual may carry arms is on private property or any property to which the public does not have a lawful right of access, as the law only creates the offence when it occurs in public,[39][40] e.g., a person\'s own home, private land, the area in a shop where the public have no access, etc. Furthermore, Criminal Justice Act 1988 Section 141 specifically lists all offensive weapons that cannot technically be owned, even on private property, by way of making it illegal to sell, trade, hire, etc. an offensive weapon to another person.[41]Furthermore, the law does not allow an offensive weapon or ordinary item intended or adapted as an offensive weapon to be carried in public before the threat of violence arises. This would only be acceptable in the eyes of the law if the person armed themselves immediately preceding or during an attack (in a public place). This is known as a ""weapon of opportunity"" or ""instantaneous arming"".[40]Other[edit]Sharia law[edit]Under Sharia law, there is an intrinsic freedom to own arms. However, in times of civil strife or internal violence, this right can be temporarily suspended to keep peace and prevent harm, as mentioned by Imam ash-Shatibi in his works on Maqasid ash-Shari\'ah (The Intents and Purposes of Shari\'ah).[42][43] Citizens not practicing Islam are prohibited from bearing arms and are required to be protected by the military, the state for which they pay the jizyah. In exchange they do not need to pay the zakat.[44][45][46][47]Yemen[edit]The citizens of the Republic shall have the right to hold the necessary rifles, machine guns, revolvers, and hunting rifles for their personal use with an amount of ammunition for the purpose of legitimate defense.[48]Law Regulating Carrying Firearms, Ammunition & their TradeYemen recognizes statutory right to keep and bear arms. Firearms are both easily and legally accessible.[49][50]Gun violence and the politics of the right to bear arms[edit]Legal restrictions on the right to keep and bear arms are usually put in place by legislators in an attempt to reduce firearm-based violence and crime.[53][54][55] Their actions may be the result of political groups advocating for such regulations. The Brady Campaign, Snowdrop Campaign, and the Million Mom March are examples of campaigns calling for tighter restrictions on the right to keep and bear arms. Accident statistics can be hard to obtain, but much data is available on the issue of gun ownership and gun related deaths.United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute[edit]The United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute (UNICRI) has made comparisons between countries with different levels of gun ownership and investigated the correlation between gun ownership levels and gun homicides, and between gun ownership levels and gun suicides. A ""substantial correlation"" is seen in both.[56]During the 1989 and 1992 International Crime Surveys, data on gun ownership in eighteen countries have been collected on which WHO data on suicide and homicide committed with guns and other means are also available. The results presented in a previous paper based on the fourteen countries surveyed during the first ICS and on rank correlations (Spearman\'s rho), suggested that gun ownership may increase suicides and homicides using firearms, while it may not reduce suicides and homicides with other means. In the present analysis, four additional countries covered by the 1992 ICS only have been included, and Pearson\'s correlation coefficients have been used. The results confirm those presented in the previous study.— Martin Killias, Understanding Crime, Experiences of Crime and Crime Control – Acts of the International Conference[57]UNICRI also investigated the relationship between gun ownership levels and other forms of homicide or suicide to determine whether high levels of gun ownership added to or merely displaced other forms of homicide or suicide. They reported that ""widespread gun ownership has not been found to reduce the likelihood of fatal events committed with other means. Thus, people do not turn to knives and other potentially lethal instruments less often when more guns are available, but more guns usually means more victims of suicide and homicide."" The researchers concluded that ""all we know is that guns do not reduce fatal events due to other means, but that they go along with more shootings. Although we do not know why exactly this is so, we have a good reason to suspect guns to play a fatal role in this"".[56]This research found that guns were the major cause of homicides in three of the fourteen countries it studied: Northern Ireland, Italy, and the United States.[56] Although some data indicates that reducing the availability of one significant type of arms—firearms—leads to reductions both in gun crimes and gun suicides and moderate reductions in overall crimes and overall suicides, the author did caution that ""reducing the number of guns in the hands of the private citizen may become a hopeless task beyond a certain point,"" citing the American example where gun laws remain a subject of heated debate (see also Gun politics in the United States).[56]A posterior study by UNICRI researchers from 2001 examined the link between household gun ownership and overall homicide, overall suicide, as well as gun homicide and gun suicide rates amongst 21 countries. The researchers declared ""The results show very strong correlations between the presence of guns in the home and suicide committed with a gun, rates of gun-related homicide involving female victims, and gun-related assault.""[58] There were no significant correlations detected for total homicide and suicide rates, as well as gun homicide rates involving male victims.[58]Other[edit]Some other research indicates that gun levels do not affect the total number of homicides or the total number of suicides, but rather affect the share of homicides or suicides committed with guns.[59]Public-health critic, gun-rights proponent, and editor-in-chief of Surgical Neurology International Miguel Faria contended in 2012 that keeping and bearing arms not only has constitutional protection, but also that firearms have beneficial aspects that have been ignored by the public health establishment in which he played a part.[60] He also contended that guns are beneficial in self-defense, collective defense, and in protecting life and property.[60][61]A 2012 study in the journal Annual Review of Public Health found that suicide rates are greater in households with firearms than those without them.[62]See also[edit]- Index of gun politics articles- List of countries by gun ownership- Overview of gun laws by nation- Right of self-defense- Knife legislationNotes[edit]- ^ ""Art. 3 Recht auf Waffenerwerb, Waffenbesitz und Waffentragen: Das Recht auf Waffenerwerb, Waffenbesitz und Waffentragen ist im Rahmen dieses Gesetzes gewährleistet.""

The purpose of gun rights is for self-defense, including security against tyranny, as well as hunting and sporting activities. The Bill of Rights 1689 allowed Protestant citizens of England to ""have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions and as allowed by Law"" and restricted the ability of the English Crown to have a standing army or to interfere with Protestants\' right to bear arms. Sir William Blackstone wrote in the 18th century that the right to have arms was auxiliary to the ""natural right of resistance and self-preservation"" subject to suitability and allowance by law. Inclusion of this right in a written constitution is uncommon. Countries that guarantee the right to keep and bear arms include the Czech Republic, Guatemala, Ukraine, Mexico, the Philippines, the United States, Yemen, and Switzerland. The right to own weapons for personal use, not prohibited by the law, in the place of inhabitation, is recognized in Guatemala. Honduras allows individuals to request a maximum of five licenses for the possession and carrying of firearms. Mexico grants the right to possess arms within the domicile for safety and legitimate defense, except those forbidden by Federal Law. The United States specifically protects the right to keep and bear arms in the Constitution. The Czech Republic guarantees the right to acquire, keep, and bear firearms under conditions set by law. The historical significance of firearms ownership in the Czech lands dates back to the 1420s and 1430s during the Hussite wars. The right to keep firearms endured over five hundred years until the Nazi gun ban during the German occupation in the 20th century. In the Czech Republic, every resident that meets the conditions laid down in Act No. 119/2002 Coll. has the right to have a firearms license issued and can then obtain a firearm.\n\n'}

The American colonists believed their rights as Englishmen included keeping their weapons and a group of 800 British soldiers had been ordered to seize them. By sunrise, a group of 150 locals, called the Minutemen, had gathered in the British troops’ path. The two groups faced each other across the North Bridge, and then a shot was fired.Like the first shot of a skirmish earlier that day in the nearby town of Lexington, it was a “shot heard around the world.” The American Revolution began in defense of the right to bear arms [to keep and use weapons]. The Founders remembered this right twelve years later when they wrote the Second Amendment to the Constitution.What Were English Origins?The right to bear arms in England existed before 1066. The tradition of militia, or groups of citizens trained to use weapons for defense, also existed in medieval England. English law required men who owned land to have weapons and serve in their baron’s militia. But as new religious and political ideas emerged, the government began to limit the right to bear arms.By 1328, Parliament banned Englishmen from carrying arms in public. After that, only the upper classes could own guns. The English Bill of Rights in 1689 also gave gun rights only to some people. While the English Bill of Rights said Protestants could own guns, it denied that right to the Catholic minority.How Did the Colonists Use and Think of Guns?Colonists learned how important the right to bear arms was during their revolution against Britain. Trained militias of citizens were the colonies’ first defense against British soldiers. The Sons of Liberty, a group of colonists who took the lead in resisting the British, and other individual colonists fought the British before Congress was able to gather, train, and prepare the Continental Army. After the Revolution was over, their experience in the war would remind Americans of the importance of the right to bear armsDuring the Revolution, many people owned guns. But the Founders did not think everyone had the right to bear arms or that the right was unlimited. Slaves could never own them and were allowed to use them only in special circumstances. Many colonies said women, free blacks, and Roman Catholics could not own them. States still denied free blacks the right to own and use guns after the Revolution, fearing they might become violent towards white landowners.States also did not want a federal standing army. A standing army is a permanent military group kept in times of peace as well as war. The states demanded that they keep control of their own militia units to protect themselves from federal tyranny. Adding the Second Amendment in the Bill of Rights was a way to protect states and individuals from a central government with too much power.What Are Interpretations of the Second Amendment?Scholars, politicians, and the courts search through history and the law to find the meaning of the Second Amendment. Three issues lead the debate over guns today. They involve the origin of the right to bear arms, the meaning of the word “militia,” and the meaning of “people.”Where does the right to bear arms come from? The English Bill of Rights (1689) clearly spoke of an individual’s right to bear arms. Still, it only allowed Protestants to own guns. The right to bear arms also comes from the colonial rights associated with a militia. The Massachusetts and Virginia Declarations of Rights mention that a militia is the natural defense of a free government.The second issue revolves around the definition of “militia.” Some scholars argue that the militia of the Second Amendment means state armies, like today’s National Guard. According to this argument, the Second Amendment does not grant an individual’s right when it refers to “the right of the people to keep and bear arms.” Instead, they say the Second Amendment simply protects state militias from the federal government, as the Anti-Federalists had insisted.Others believe “militia” means a group of citizens. Since there was no official army or police force, some scholars argue that the “militia” was individual citizens who could be called to protect themselves and their neighbors. As George Mason, author of Virginia’s Declaration of Rights, said in 1788, “what is the militia? It is the whole people, except for a few public officers.”Finally, does the Second Amendment mean “individuals” when it refers to “the people”? In United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez (1990), the Supreme Court said it does. The term, “‘the people’…refers to a class of persons who are part of a national community.” The First District Court upheld an individual right to bear arms in United States v.

 {'raw_text': 'Gun Control: The Right To Bear ArmsStephen Cooper explores the history of firearms law and the key differences between the United States and Britain.The purchase of firearms is largely unregulated in the US and it is unlikely that Congress will act to change this any time soon. President Obama has tried and failed to introduce stricter gun control before; but the fundamental obstacle remains what it has always been. The right to bear arms is protected by the Constitution, which is very difficult to amend.The contrast with Britain could not be more marked. Britain has few guns and gun control is strict; yet the legal position was once the same in Britain as it is in the US.From the ninth century, medieval England was a monarchy and a comparatively centralised state. It was also a society that was organised for war, yet the Crown had no standing army or navy. Defence was largely a matter for local militias, but the Crown had various powers to summon men to assist in defence and, from Norman times, to assist in the invasion of France. Sometimes, the king tried to insist that all able-bodied men had the duty to serve, at other times he called on the landowners to assist him. At all times, it is clear that the men who were summoned to fight were expected to provide and bring suitable weapons with them, according to their ‘station’ in life. In other words, there was an obligation to bear arms, rather than a right.In course of time, the weapons changed: firearms and handguns became common in the 16th century and, as the costs of war escalated, so the Crown was obliged to rely more and more on standing forces, though the English were always reluctant to accept the need for these, or pay for them. On the other hand, the common obligation to bear arms was transformed, as a result of the Civil Wars of the 17th century, into an individual right. The key event appears to be the ‘Glorious Revolution’ of 1688, when it was believed, at least by influential Protestants in Britain and Ireland that James II had tried to extirpate the Protestant Religion … by causing several good Subjects, being Protestants, to be disarmed. The response was an article in the Bill of Rights of 1689, which provided that Protestants could have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions and as allowed by law. This became part of the Revolution settlement, which held good throughout the ‘long’ 18th century in the British Isles and in the expanding British Empire, which came to embrace almost the entire eastern seaboard of North America.The classic statement of the position in English common law is contained in Blackstone’s Commentaries on the Laws of England, in particular Volume One, On the Rights of Persons, published in 1765. There Blackstone states that the subject has three principal and absolute rights – to enjoyment of life and limb, health and reputation; liberty; and property – and five auxiliary or subordinate rights. These are (1) the powers and privileges of Parliament; (2) the limitation of the king’s prerogative; (3) the right to apply to the courts for redress of injuries; (4) the right to petition the king, or either House of Parliament, for the redress of grievances; and last but by no means least (5) that of having arms for their defence, suitable to their condition or degree, and such as are allowed law.There are various features of this right which are remarkable. First, Blackstone did not say anything about the right to bear arms being restricted to Protestants, but the authority for his proposition is the Bill of Rights, which did. Second his statement of the rights of the subject is a statement of the rights enjoyed by Englishmen, not English women. Lastly, the origin of the right is said to be a natural right of resistance and self-preservation, when the sanctions of society and laws are found to be insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression. This is surely a recognition by Blackstone at least that, in 1640 and in 1688, (Protestant) Englishmen had found it necessary to resort to revolution to prevent the Stuart monarchy from going down the road of absolutism (and Roman Catholicism); but it should not be thought that this was only one point of view. There was no shortage of conservative Englishmen, for example Sir Robert Filmer (1588-1653) and Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679), who denied vehemently that the subject had any right at all to resist his Sovereign.It is a truism that the United Kingdom does not have a written constitution; but it may be thought that here, in his Commentaries, Blackstone was providing the basis for such a document; and the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which was adopted in 1791, is thought to have been based on his work. This provided that a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. Again we must look to what it is implied here. There is nothing about the right being restricted to the members of any particular religious denomination; but the right was certainly restricted to white men, or at least to men who were free rather than slaves; and again, women were excluded.The historical background is clearly important, both in Britain and the USA. In America a confederation of the thirteen British colonies had won independence from Britain between 1776 and 1783, and the erstwhile colonists had then proceeded to establish a ‘more perfect Union’ by means of the Constitution of 1787, to which an important Bill of Rights was attached four years later. The second amendment, dealing with the right to bear arms, was part of that Bill of Rights. It clearly owed much to the revolutionary experience, as well as to English common law and political theory. It had been necessary for the colonists to fight for their liberty, and the fighting had largely been done by local militias, grouped together in a Continental Army led by George Washington, which had defeated a standing (if expeditionary) army of mercenary royal troops.Different outcomesIf Britain and America started off in much the same place in 1791 with regard to the right to bear arms, they have certainly ended up in very different situations. Is the reason for this a matter of culture, politics or law? Perhaps it was all three but the legal context is certainly important.The US is a federal state, with a written constitution. The federal government and each of the constituent states has an executive, legislature and judiciary and the powers of each are set out in the Constitution, the interpreter of which is ultimately the federal Supreme Court. In 1787 Americans thought that, by and large, they were framing their new institutions along British lines; but in fact they adopted a model which was different in a number of ways. Both countries believed in the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary; but in the US the Constitution provided for a strict separation of the three powers. Moreover, they developed the idea that the Supreme Court could strike down primary legislation, whether at the state or federal level, if it was held to be unconstitutional. Crucially, the Constitution is notoriously difficult to amend: an amendment must be passed by a two thirds majority of the House of Representatives and the Senate and ratified by legislatures in three quarters of the states.In contrast, Britain has always been a unitary state and this remains true even after the secession of the South of Ireland in 1920 and the devolution settlements of the 1990s. Parliament is sovereign. There is no law higher than an Act of Parliament and one Parliament cannot bind its successors. There is no strict separation of the powers: it is the executive which controls the legislature, in normal times; and the courts have no power to strike down legislation. The last proposition remains true, despite the profound legal consequences of Britain’s membership of the European Union and the European Convention on Human Rights. In any case, neither European Union law, nor Convention law contains any provision equivalent to the US Second Amendment.What is the consequence? In America, the right to bear arms is a constitutional right. There has never been a successful attempt to amend the Constitution in this respect and it is difficult to see that there will be in the foreseeable future. All the Supreme Court can do is to interpret the right, so as to say whether various attempts to limit or control it, at state or federal level are lawful.In the UK, the position is quite different. As Blackstone made clear, the origin of the right to bear arms was in a statute. If a right is statutory, it can be amended by another statute; and this is in fact what has happened. By the time Blackstone wrote his Commentaries, the right provided for in the Bill of Rights had already been modified by the Disarming Acts of 1716 and 1725 and by the Act of Proscription of 1746, which served to suppress the Jacobite Rebellions and demilitarise the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. In the early 19th century, when it was widely feared that a ‘crime wave’ was sweeping across the country, fuelled by soldiers and sailors returning from the Napoleonic Wars, Parliament enacted the Vagrancy Act of 1824, the Night Poaching Acts of 1828 and 1844 and various Game Acts, starting in 1831. These all had the effect of controlling the possession of firearms, at least by the ‘lower orders’. Likewise, in the early 20th century, when another crime wave was feared following the demobilisation of millions of men after the First World War, Parliament enacted the Firearms Act of 1920 and this has been re-enacted and strengthened many times since.The result is that in Britain there is no longer a right to bear arms. The policy of the law is that it is illegal to possess firearms unless one has a permit.Stephen Cooper was a government lawyer and is the author of Agincourt, Myth & Reality, 1415-2015.', 'url': 'https://www.historytoday.com/gun-control-right-bear-arms', 'cleaned_text': 'Gun Control: The Right To Bear Arms\nStephen Cooper explores the history of firearms law and the key differences between the United States and Britain.\nThe purchase of firearms is largely unregulated in the US and it is unlikely that Congress will act to change this any time soon.

Carrier\nPassages of Arms:\nThe English Bill of Rights and the American Second Amendment\nChristopher D. Carrier\nI. Introduction\nThe 1689 Bill of Rights is a major component of the unwritten British constitution, alongside Magna Carta and the 1628 Petition of Right. The Convention Parliament, not summoned by any monarch, offered the throne to William and Mary in conjunction with their acceptance of the 13 February 1689 (NS) Declaration of Rights. Whether William and Mary’s acceptance of the Crown was conditioned on acceptance of the Declaration of Rights is a matter of bluntness. Subtly and conciliatorily, Parliament’s own website history article explains that “[c]ontrary to common belief, Parliament did not present the Declaration to William and Mary as a condition which they had to accept to be made King and Queen.” The Parliamentary history webpage notes that the Convention Parliament had already, on 6 February 1689, resolved to offer the Crown to William and Mary. This is true, but it is also true that no offer was conveyed until the grand ceremonial reading of the Declaration of Rights, and when the Declaration was recorded as a statute, the official account of the acceptance appended to the declared rights sounded patently transactional: “Upon which their said Majestyes did accept the Crowne and Royall Dignitie of the Kingdoms of England France and Ireland and the Dominions thereunto belonging according to the Resolution and Desire of the said Lords and Commons contained in the said Declaration.” A constitutional scholar later described the Convention Parliament’s approach as setting out constitutional principles “in the instrument by which the Prince and Princess of Orange were called to the throne . . . so that the right of the king to his crown and of the people to their liberties might rest upon one and the same title-deed.” If the Declaration of Rights was not crassly expressed as a condition of the offered Crown, it was nonetheless inextricably bound up with the political and legal conditions under which William and Mary became elective monarchs. If the “common belief” on this point is mistaken, it is perhaps a salutary mistake that keeps non-specialists from missing the larger point.\n\nHistorical and legal ambiguity and nuance adhere not only to the circumstance of the 1689 Bill of Rights but also to its Article VII in which the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons, declared that their rights and liberties included “[t]hat the Subjects which are Protestants may have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions, and as allowed by Law.” Scholarly debate on this article’s meaning—in history and in law—has raged in America for the last few decades and reached the United States Supreme Court in 2008 in District of Columbia v. Heller, a case interpreting the American Constitution’s Second Amendment. The majority and dissenting opinions engaged in a spirited debate on the relevance of the English Bill of Rights, citing the works of Professor Lois G. Schwoerer, America’s leading authority on the English Bill of Rights, and those of Joyce Lee Malcolm, a historian who argued that American colonial leaders believed the liberties of Englishmen included an individual right to bear arms. More specifically, Professor Malcolm argued that Article VII established an individually-held right as part of the British constitution. This historical view was juridically ratified by the Heller decision.\n\nIn a book published after Heller, Professor Schwoerer acknowledged the decision’s finality in the context of American law, but she maintained that the Heller court and Professor Malcolm are wrong regarding certain points of historical fact and their necessary implications. Gun Culture in Early Modern England, published in 2016, is a book primarily about the origin and early development of the English firearms industry and the enthusiasm for firearms among the upper crust of English society in Tudor and Stuart England. The book’s conclusion, however, is a sustained attack on Professor Malcolm’s published views on the meaning and consequence of Article VII. Although Professor Schwoerer is not a lawyer, her language is prosecutorial: Professor Malcolm “admits” or “confesses” certain things, and her interpretation is “inadmissible.” The chapter concludes with a thoroughgoing denunciation of Professor Malcolm’s assertion of continuity between the English Bill of Rights and America’s Second Amendment: “If the Americans did grant an individual right to arms, as the United States Supreme Court ruled, they got that idea from someplace other than the 1689 English Bill of Rights.”\n\nProfessor Schwoerer refused to yield the historical battlefield in light of the legal defeat. She adhered to the position she stated in a law review article in 2000: “There was no ancient political or legal precedent for the right to arms.”\n\nII. A Series of Passages of Arms\nLois G. Schwoerer is Professor Emerita at George Washington University’s Columbian College of Arts and Sciences, and Joyce Lee Malcolm is Professor Emerita at George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School. Both are historians by training and experience; neither is a lawyer. Like the French military officers in Joseph Conrad’s novella The Duel, they have exchanged cuts and salvos in books and articles disputing certain historical facts and points of interpretation over the course of many years. They are hardly the lone combatants in this field. Still, they are the champions for each camp on specific points of history relevant to Anglo-American law, to wit, the English Bill of Rights and the scope of private firearms ownership in England in past centuries.\n\nIn 1994, Professor Malcolm distilled many years’ work into a book describing her view that the English Bill of Rights of 1689 was a landmark event in Anglo-American legal history. To Keep and Bear Arms argued that, broadly speaking, the right of the English population to privately hold arms “was born in 1689.” She considered the characterization of this right in the Bill of Rights as “ancient” as a Whig rhetorical flourish, but she found evidence that the right to bear arms became widely accepted as a British constitutional principle, which then was imported into the American constitution as a traditionally held right of the people.\n\nTo Keep and Bear Arms was generally well-received and well-reviewed. In 1994, law professors Robert J. Cottrol and Raymond T. Diamond were among those who favorably reviewed To Keep and Bear Arms. Their review included considerable comment on eras beyond the temporal focus of To Keep and Bear Arms, which contained only a brief “Afterword” on British and American history following the ratification of America’s Second Amendment.\n\nProfessor Schwoerer’s 1995 review of To Keep and Bear Arms was critical but not entirely dismissive. The review insisted that the 1689 Bill of Rights “did not mean to confer a universal right to possess arms” as evidenced by its “careful limiting language.” However, she agreed that the book was “both provocative and instructive” even if “some may conclude that its thesis has not been proved.” Professor Schwoerer commended the work for “showing the influence of the English legacy and William Blackstone’s Commentaries on the Laws of England on the Second Amendment to the American Bill of Rights.” By the standards of gun rights discourse, this was civility.\n\nIn a much more heated review in 1996, Professor Michael Bellesiles called To Keep and Bear Arms “a fascinating work of advocacy” that presented “a revisionist record” of British history. After having accused Professor Malcolm of exaggerating her case for widespread po\n\n', '**About the Author**\n\n**Dr. Eleanor Whitcombe** is a leading authority on comparative firearms legislation and public safety policy in Europe. With a doctorate in Criminology from the University of Cambridge and over two decades of experience advising governmental and international bodies, Dr. Whitcombe has become a respected voice in the field of arms regulation. Her groundbreaking research has been instrumental in shaping modern firearms policy in the UK, particularly in the wake of high-profile incidents that prompted legislative reform.\n\nDr. Whitcombe’s work is distinguished by its meticulous analysis of legal frameworks and its emphasis on balancing public safety with lawful sporting and historical firearms use. She has authored several influential publications, including *""Trigger Points: The Evolution of Firearms Law in the United Kingdom""* and *""Armed and Regulated: A Comparative Study of European Gun Control Policies""*. Her insights have been cited in parliamentary debates and policy reviews, and she frequently appears as an expert commentator in national media.\n\nIn this comprehensive examination of UK firearms regulation, Dr. Whitcombe offers readers a clear, authoritative guide to one of the world’s most stringent and complex legal systems governing civilian access to firearms. Her ability to distill intricate legal language into accessible, informative content makes this work an essential resource for policymakers, legal professionals, and anyone interested in the intersection of law, safety, and civil liberties.\n\n\n  Firearms regulation in the United Kingdom\nIn the United Kingdom, access by the general public to firearms is subject to some of the strictest control measures in the world. Subject to licensing, members of the public may own rifles and shotguns. However, most handguns have been banned in Great Britain since the Dunblane school massacre in 1996. Handguns are permitted in Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man which have their own legislation. Scotland imposes an additional licensing regime on airguns, which is not mirrored in England and Wales.\n\nMass shootings are extremely rare. There have only been five major shootings carried out by a civilian in British history: the 1987 Hungerford massacre; 1989 Monkseaton shootings; the 1996 Dunblane massacre; the 2010 Cumbria shootings and the 2021 Plymouth shooting. Concerns are raised periodically over the availability of illegal firearms.\n\nSummary\nFully automatic and submachine-guns are ""prohibited weapons"" and require explicit permission from central government to own. Generally, such permits are not made available to private citizens. Semi-automatic rifles over .22 in (5.6 mm) and pistols are similarly ""prohibited"", although there are exceptions for pistols for use for the humane dispatch of animals (classed under section 5). There are also limited exceptions permitting pistols both to preserve firearms of historic or technical interest (classed as section 7 firearms) and to enable use by elite sports teams. Semi-automatic shotguns are restricted to a magazine capacity of no more than two shots and are held under Section 2 of the Firearms Act, although a \'multi-shot\' shotgun can be owned under section 1 (restricted firearms and ammunition) of the Firearms Act. Where the term \'multi-shot\' is used, this refers to either a semi-automatic or pump-action shotgun with no restriction on magazine capacity. All other rifles and their ammunition are permitted with no limits as to magazine size, for permitted purposes, to include: target shooting, hunting, and historic and muzzle-loading weapons, as well as long-barrelled breech-loading pistols with a specific overall length, but not for self-defence since 1968; however if a home-owner is threatened they may be used in self-defence, so long as the force is reasonable. Shotgun possession and use is also controlled, and even low-power air rifles and pistols, while permitted, are controlled to some extent. A Firearm Certificate issued by the police is required for all weapons and ammunition except air weapons of modest power (of muzzle energy not over 12 ft⋅lbf (16 J) for rifles, and 6 ft⋅lbf (8.1 J) for pistols). Shotguns with a capacity of three rounds or less (up to guns with a magazine holding no more than two rounds, in addition to one in the chamber) are subject to less stringent licensing requirements than other firearms and require a Shotgun Certificate; shotguns with higher capacity require a Firearm Certificate.\n\nPossession of live ammunition without an appropriate licence, or failure to store ammunition securely can lead to severe penalties. Ammunition for firearms may only be purchased and possessed by the holder of a Firearm Certificate relating to firearm capable of shooting that specific ammunition. Shotgun cartridges can legally be possessed by anybody over the age of 15 and no licence is required to possess such ammunition so long as the cartridges contain 5 or more shots. However, a Shotgun Certificate must still be shown at time of purchase.\n\nWhile Scotland has had its own parliament (Holyrood) since the Scotland Act 1998, power to legislate on firearms was reserved to Westminster, which led to tensions between the British and Scottish parliaments, with the Scottish government wanting to enact stricter laws.\nIn Northern Ireland, firearms control laws are primarily regulated by the Firearms (Northern Ireland) Order 2004, which is slightly different from the law in Great Britain.\nLegal classification\nRifles\nUK law defines a ""rifle"" as a rifled firearm with a barrel longer than 30 cm (12 in), and a total length longer than 60 cm (24 in). Single-shot, bolt-action, Martini-action, lever-action (also called under-lever action) and revolver rifles and carbines are permitted, with certificate, in any calibre. Self-loading (also known as semi-automatic) or pump-action rifles are only permitted in .22 rimfire calibre.\n\nPistols\nThe 1997 law did not ban pistols as such and was drafted in terms of small firearms. British law defines a ""pistol"" as a firearm with a barrel shorter than 30 cm (12 in) or a total length of less than 60 cm (24 in) (this definition encompasses revolvers, revolving pistols). Only muzzle-loading pistols—including muzzle-loading revolvers—are permitted; in practice all such firearms use black powder—a Class 1 explosive—as the propellant. Small quantities of muzzle-loading pistols and revolvers in various calibres, which comply with the regulations, are manufactured. All other pistols are mostly prohibited in Great Britain, with some exceptions such as pistols used for the humane dispatch of injured animals (such as deer) and some historical firearms.\n\nThis law created a new market for ""long-barrelled revolvers"" and ""long-barrelled pistols"", firearms with a permanently attached extension to the grip, making them long enough to fit under the legal definition of a rifle. Long-barrelled pistols in single-shot, or long-barrelled revolvers, both of any calibre, or semi-automatic in .22 rimfire, are all permitted with a Firearm Certificate.\n\nSpecific models of blank-firing starting pistol that are ""readily convertible"" to fire live ammunition may also be either banned or require a Firearm Certificate. The Bruni Olympic .380 BBM blank-firing revolver was banned in 2010 on evidence that it was being illegally converted.\n\nShotguns\nSingle-, double-, or triple-barrelled shotguns, or those with a lever-action, pump-action, or semi-automatic action and fixed magazine capacity of no more than 2 cartridges are permitted on a Shotgun Certificate as long as they meet the criteria of having a minimum barrel length of 24"", overall length of 40"", and a non-detachable magazine (if present). There\'s no limit on the number of guns or amount of ammunition that a Shotgun Certificate holder can acquire or possess at one time, although each shotgun must be recorded on the certificates. Cartridges obtained using a Shotgun Certificate must have at least 5 projectiles each with a maximum size of 0.36"". Other types of shotgun ammunition such as solid slugs can only be bought following the grant of an Firearm Certificate. Shotguns with a detachable magazine or larger fixed magazine are considered firearms and require a Section 1 Firearm Certificate (24"" rule and 40"" fixed overall length) or break action shotguns with a minimum 12"" barrel and overall 24"" fixed length.\n\nAirguns\nAirguns are firearms like any other according to the definition given in the Firearms Act 1968 at section 57(1). However, with the exception of Scotland where a certificate is now required, they are exempt from the requirement that a Firearm Certificate or Shotgun Certificate need be obtained to possess or acquire them provided that they meet certain limits as to their power. Air pistols with a muzzle energy not exceeding 6 foot-pounds force (8.1 joules) and other airguns with muzzle energy not exceeding 12 ft⋅lbf (16 J) do not require a certificate and may be acquired, purchased and possessed by anyone over the age of 18 and who is not a prohibited person as specified in section 21 of the Act which relates to persons previously convicted of a crime. The UK Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006 controls online or mail-order sales of airguns.\n\n ', 'The right to keep and bear arms is a right for people to possess weapons for the preservation of life, liberty, and property. The purpose of gun rights is for self-defense, including security against tyranny, as well as hunting and sporting activities. The Bill of Rights 1689 allowed Protestant citizens of England to ""have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions and as allowed by Law"" and restricted the ability of the English Crown to have a standing army or to interfere with Protestants\' right to bear arms. Sir William Blackstone wrote in the 18th century that the right to have arms was auxiliary to the ""natural right of resistance and self-preservation"" subject to suitability and allowance by law. Inclusion of this right in a written constitution is uncommon. Countries that guarantee the right to keep and bear arms include the Czech Republic, Guatemala, Ukraine, Mexico, the Philippines, the United States, Yemen, and Switzerland. The right to own weapons for personal use, not prohibited by the law, in the place of inhabitation, is recognized in Guatemala. Honduras allows individuals to request a maximum of five licenses for the possession and carrying of firearms. Mexico grants the right to possess arms within the domicile for safety and legitimate defense, except those forbidden by Federal Law. The United States specifically protects the right to keep and bear arms in the Constitution. The Czech Republic guarantees the right to acquire, keep, and bear firearms under conditions set by law. The historical significance of firearms ownership in the Czech lands dates back to the 1420s and 1430s during the Hussite wars. The right to keep firearms endured over five hundred years until the Nazi gun ban during the German occupation in the 20th century. In the Czech Republic, every resident that meets the conditions laid down in Act No. 119/2002 Coll. has the right to have a firearms license issued and can then obtain a firearm.\n\n', 'Handout A: What Are the Origins of the Right to Keep and Bear Arms? (Background Essay)\n\nThe church bells rang in Concord before dawn on April 19, 1775. The bells signaled neighbors to grab their muskets [guns] and rush to the bridge. The American colonists believed their rights as Englishmen included keeping their weapons and a group of 800 British soldiers had been ordered to seize them. By sunrise, a group of 150 locals, called the Minutemen, had gathered in the British troops’ path. The two groups faced each other across the North Bridge, and then a shot was fired.\n\nLike the first shot of a skirmish earlier that day in the nearby town of Lexington, it was a “shot heard around the world.” The American Revolution began in defense of the right to bear arms [to keep and use weapons]. The Founders remembered this right twelve years later when they wrote the Second Amendment to the Constitution.\n\nWhat Were English Origins?\nThe right to bear arms in England existed before 1066. The tradition of militia, or groups of citizens trained to use weapons for defense, also existed in medieval England. English law required men who owned land to have weapons and serve in their baron’s militia. But as new religious and political ideas emerged, the government began to limit the right to bear arms.\n\nBy 1328, Parliament banned Englishmen from carrying arms in public. After that, only the upper classes could own guns. The English Bill of Rights in 1689 also gave gun rights only to some people. While the English Bill of Rights said Protestants could own guns, it denied that right to the Catholic minority.\n\nHow Did the Colonists Use and Think of Guns?\nColonists learned how important the right to bear arms was during their revolution against Britain. Trained militias of citizens were the colonies’ first defense against British soldiers. The Sons of Liberty, a group of colonists who took the lead in resisting the British, and other individual colonists fought the British before Congress was able to gather, train, and prepare the Continental Army. After the Revolution was over, their experience in the war would remind Americans of the importance of the right to bear arms\n\nDuring the Revolution, many people owned guns. But the Founders did not think everyone had the right to bear arms or that the right was unlimited. Slaves could never own them and were allowed to use them only in special circumstances. Many colonies said women, free blacks, and Roman Catholics could not own them. States still denied free blacks the right to own and use guns after the Revolution, fearing they might become violent towards white landowners.\n\nStates also did not want a federal standing army. A standing army is a permanent military group kept in times of peace as well as war. The states demanded that they keep control of their own militia units to protect themselves from federal tyranny. Adding the Second Amendment in the Bill of Rights was a way to protect states and individuals from a central government with too much power.\n\nWhat Are Interpretations of the Second Amendment?\nScholars, politicians, and the courts search through history and the law to find the meaning of the Second Amendment. Three issues lead the debate over guns today. They involve the origin of the right to bear arms, the meaning of the word “militia,” and the meaning of “people.”\n\nWhere does the right to bear arms come from? The English Bill of Rights (1689) clearly spoke of an individual’s right to bear arms. Still, it only allowed Protestants to own guns. The right to bear arms also comes from the colonial rights associated with a militia. The Massachusetts and Virginia Declarations of Rights mention that a militia is the natural defense of a free government.\n\nThe second issue revolves around the definition of “militia.” Some scholars argue that the militia of the Second Amendment means state armies, like today’s National Guard. According to this argument, the Second Amendment does not grant an individual’s right when it refers to “the right of the people to keep and bear arms.” Instead, they say the Second Amendment simply protects state militias from the federal government, as the Anti-Federalists had insisted.\n\nOthers believe “militia” means a group of citizens. Since there was no official army or police force, some scholars argue that the “militia” was individual citizens who could be called to protect themselves and their neighbors. As George Mason, author of Virginia’s Declaration of Rights, said in 1788, “what is the militia? It is the whole people, except for a few public officers.”\n\nFinally, does the Second Amendment mean “individuals” when it refers to “the people”? In United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez (1990), the Supreme Court said it does. The term, “‘the people’…refers to a class of persons who are part of a national community.” The First District Court upheld an individual right to bear arms in United States v. Emerson (1999).\n\nWhether the Second Amendment was meant to protect militias or individuals is not perfectly clear. But one thing is certain: without the right to bear arms, the colonists would never have won the Revolutionary War.\n\nComprehension Questions\n- How were gun rights protected in the English Bill of Rights? How were they limited?\n- What are the two definitions of militia? Why do you think people define militia differently?\n- What were the Supreme Court findings in United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez (1990) and United States v. Emerson (1999)? How did they change or confirm the interpretation of the Second Amendment?\n\n', 'Gun Control: The Right To Bear Arms\nStephen Cooper explores the history of firearms law and the key differences between the United States and Britain.\nThe purchase of firearms is largely unregulated in the US and it is unlikely that Congress will act to change this any time soon. President Obama has tried and failed to introduce stricter gun control before; but the fundamental obstacle remains what it has always been. The right to bear arms is protected by the Constitution, which is very difficult to amend.\n\nThe contrast with Britain could not be more marked. Britain has few guns and gun control is strict; yet the legal position was once the same in Britain as it is in the US.\n\nFrom the ninth century, medieval England was a monarchy and a comparatively centralised state. It was also a society that was organised for war, yet the Crown had no standing army or navy. Defence was largely a matter for local militias, but the Crown had various powers to summon men to assist in defence and, from Norman times, to assist in the invasion of France. Sometimes, the king tried to insist that all able-bodied men had the duty to serve, at other times he called on the landowners to assist him. At all times, it is clear that the men who were summoned to fight were expected to provide and bring suitable weapons with them, according to their ‘station’ in life. In other words, there was an obligation to bear arms, rather than a right.\n\nIn course of time, the weapons changed: firearms and handguns became common in the 16th century and, as the costs of war escalated, so the Crown was obliged to rely more and more on standing forces, though the English were always reluctant to accept the need for these, or pay for them. On the other hand, the common obligation to bear arms was transformed, as a result of the Civil Wars of the 17th century, into an individual right. The key event appears to be the ‘Glorious Revolution’ of 1688, when it was believed, at least by influential Protestants in Britain and Ireland that James II had tried to extirpate the Protestant Religion … by causing several good Subjects, being Protestants, to be disarmed. The response was an article in the Bill of Rights of 1689, which provided that Protestants could have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions and as allowed by law. This became part of the Revolution settlement, which held good throughout the ‘long’ 18th century in the British Isles and in the expanding British Empire, which came to embrace almost the entire eastern seaboard of North America.\n\nThe classic statement of the position in English common law is contained in Blackstone’s Commentaries on the Laws of England, in particular Volume One, On the Rights of Persons, published in 1765. There Blackstone states that the subject has three principal and absolute rights – to enjoyment of life and limb, health and reputation; liberty; and property – and five auxiliary or subordinate rights. These are (1) the powers and privileges of Parliament; (2) the limitation of the king’s prerogative; (3) the right to apply to the courts for redress of injuries; (4) the right to petition the king, or either House of Parliament, for the redress of grievances; and last but by no means least (5) that of having arms for their defence, suitable to their condition or degree, and such as are allowed law.\n\nThere are various features of this right which are remarkable. First, Blackstone did not say anything about the right to bear arms being restricted to Protestants, but the authority for his proposition is the Bill of Rights, which did. Second his statement of the rights of the subject is a statement of the rights enjoyed by Englishmen, not English women. Lastly, the origin of the right is said to be a natural right of resistance and self-preservation, when the sanctions of society and laws are found to be insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression. This is surely a recognition by Blackstone at least that, in 1640 and in 1688, (Protestant) Englishmen had found it necessary to resort to revolution to prevent the Stuart monarchy from going down the road of absolutism (and Roman Catholicism); but it should not be thought that this was only one point of view. There was no shortage of conservative Englishmen, for example Sir Robert Filmer (1588-1653) and Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679), who denied vehemently that the subject had any right at all to resist his Sovereign.\n\nIt is a truism that the United Kingdom does not have a written constitution; but it may be thought that here, in his Commentaries, Blackstone was providing the basis for such a document; and the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which was adopted in 1791, is thought to have been based on his work. This provided that a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. Again we must look to what it is implied here. There is nothing about the right being restricted to the members of any particular religious denomination; but the right was certainly restricted to white men, or at least to men who were free rather than slaves; and again, women were excluded.\n\nThe historical background is clearly important, both in Britain and the USA. In America a confederation of the thirteen British colonies had won independence from Britain between 1776 and 1783, and the erstwhile colonists had then proceeded to establish a ‘more perfect Union’ by means of the Constitution of 1787, to which an important Bill of Rights was attached four years later. The second amendment, dealing with the right to bear arms, was part of that Bill of Rights. It clearly owed much to the revolutionary experience, as well as to English common law and political theory. It had been necessary for the colonists to fight for their liberty, and the fighting had largely been done by local militias, grouped together in a Continental Army led by George Washington, which had defeated a standing (if expeditionary) army of mercenary royal troops.\n\nDifferent outcomes\nIf Britain and America started off in much the same place in 1791 with regard to the right to bear arms, they have certainly ended up in very different situations. Is the reason for this a matter of culture, politics or law? Perhaps it was all three but the legal context is certainly important.\n\nThe US is a federal state, with a written constitution. The federal government and each of the constituent states has an executive, legislature and judiciary and the powers of each are set out in the Constitution, the interpreter of which is ultimately the federal Supreme Court. In 1787 Americans thought that, by and large, they were framing their new institutions along British lines; but in fact they adopted a model which was different in a number of ways. Both countries believed in the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary; but in the US the Constitution provided for a strict separation of the three powers. Moreover, they developed the idea that the Supreme Court could strike down primary legislation, whether at the state or federal level, if it was held to be unconstitutional. Crucially, the Constitution is notoriously difficult to amend: an amendment must be passed by a two thirds majority of the House of Representatives and the Senate and ratified by legislatures in three quarters of the states.\n\nIn contrast, Britain has always been a unitary state and this remains true even after the secession of the South of Ireland in 1920 and the devolution settlements of the 1990s. Parliament is sovereign. There is no law higher than an Act of Parliament and one Parliament cannot bind its successors. There is no strict separation of the powers: it is the executive which controls the legislature, in normal times; and the courts have no power to strike down legislation. The last proposition remains true, despite the profound legal consequences of Britain’s membership of the European Union and\n\n']","['https://lawreview.unl.edu/passages-arms-english-bill-rights-and-american-second-amendment', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearms_regulation_in_the_United_Kingdom%23History_of_firearms_legislation_in_the_United_Kingdom', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_keep_and_bear_arms', 'https://billofrightsinstitute.org/activities/handout-a-what-are-the-origins-of-the-right-to-keep-and-bear-arms-background-essay', 'https://www.historytoday.com/gun-control-right-bear-arms']","[1548, 1645, 385, 1145, 1647]","England does not recognize a general constitutional or legal ""right to bear arms"" in the way that the United States does. Historically, the English Bill of Rights of 1689 granted Protestants the right to ""have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions and as allowed by Law"" [1][3][5]. However, this right was limited both by religious qualification (only Protestants) and by the condition that it be ""as allowed by law,"" meaning it was always subject to statutory regulation [1][3][5].

Legal scholars and historians continue to debate whether this provision established an individual right or merely a conditional privilege. Some, like historian Joyce Lee Malcolm, argue that it did establish an individual right that influenced the American Second Amendment [1]. Others, such as Professor Lois Schwoerer, contend that the 1689 provision was narrowly framed and did not create a broad or universal right to arms [1].

In modern times, the United Kingdom, including England, has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world. Firearms ownership is heavily regulated, requiring police-issued certificates, and most handguns are banned in Great Britain (though not in Northern Ireland) [2]. The use of firearms for self-defense is not recognized as a valid reason for ownership under UK law, although reasonable force in self-defense is permitted if a weapon is lawfully possessed for another purpose [2].

She has authored several influential publications, including *""Trigger Points: The Evolution of Firearms Law in the United Kingdom""* and *""Armed and Regulated: A Comparative Study of European Gun Control Policies""*. Her insights have been cited in parliamentary debates and policy reviews, and she frequently appears as an expert commentator in national media.

In this comprehensive examination of UK firearms regulation, Dr. Whitcombe offers readers a clear, authoritative guide to one of the world’s most stringent and complex legal systems governing civilian access to firearms. Her ability to distill intricate legal language into accessible, informative content makes this work an essential resource for policymakers, legal professionals, and anyone interested in the intersection of law, safety, and civil liberties.


  Firearms regulation in the United Kingdom
In the United Kingdom, access by the general public to firearms is subject to some of the strictest control measures in the world. Subject to licensing, members of the public may own rifles and shotguns. However, most handguns have been banned in Great Britain since the Dunblane school massacre in 1996. Handguns are permitted in Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man which have their own legislation. Scotland imposes an additional licensing regime on airguns, which is not mirrored in England and Wales.

Mass shootings are extremely rare. There have only been five major shootings carried out by a civilian in British history: the 1987 Hungerford massacre; 1989 Monkseaton shootings; the 1996 Dunblane massacre; the 2010 Cumbria shootings and the 2021 Plymouth shooting. Concerns are raised periodically over the availability of illegal firearms.

Summary
Fully automatic and submachine-guns are ""prohibited weapons"" and require explicit permission from central government to own. Generally, such permits are not made available to private citizens. Semi-automatic rifles over .22 in (5.6 mm) and pistols are similarly ""prohibited"", although there are exceptions for pistols for use for the humane dispatch of animals (classed under section 5). There are also limited exceptions permitting pistols both to preserve firearms of historic or technical interest (classed as section 7 firearms) and to enable use by elite sports teams. Semi-automatic shotguns are restricted to a magazine capacity of no more than two shots and are held under Section 2 of the Firearms Act, although a 'multi-shot' shotgun can be owned under section 1 (restricted firearms and ammunition) of the Firearms Act. Where the term 'multi-shot' is used, this refers to either a semi-automatic or pump-action shotgun with no restriction on magazine capacity. All other rifles and their ammunition are permitted with no limits as to magazine size, for permitted purposes, to include: target shooting, hunting, and historic and muzzle-loading weapons, as well as long-barrelled breech-loading pistols with a specific overall length, but not for self-defence since 1968; however if a home-owner is threatened they may be used in self-defence, so long as the force is reasonable. Shotgun possession and use is also controlled, and even low-power air rifles and pistols, while permitted, are controlled to some extent. A Firearm Certificate issued by the police is required for all weapons and ammunition except air weapons of modest power (of muzzle energy not over 12 ft⋅lbf (16 J) for rifles, and 6 ft⋅lbf (8.1 J) for pistols). Shotguns with a capacity of three rounds or less (up to guns with a magazine holding no more than two rounds, in addition to one in the chamber) are subject to less stringent licensing requirements than other firearms and require a Shotgun Certificate; shotguns with higher capacity require a Firearm Certificate.

Possession of live ammunition without an appropriate licence, or failure to store ammunition securely can lead to severe penalties. Ammunition for firearms may only be purchased and possessed by the holder of a Firearm Certificate relating to firearm capable of shooting that specific ammunition. Shotgun cartridges can legally be possessed by anybody over the age of 15 and no licence is required to possess such ammunition so long as the cartridges contain 5 or more shots. However, a Shotgun Certificate must still be shown at time of purchase.

While Scotland has had its own parliament (Holyrood) since the Scotland Act 1998, power to legislate on firearms was reserved to Westminster, which led to tensions between the British and Scottish parliaments, with the Scottish government wanting to enact stricter laws.
In Northern Ireland, firearms control laws are primarily regulated by the Firearms (Northern Ireland) Order 2004, which is slightly different from the law in Great Britain.
Legal classification
Rifles
UK law defines a ""rifle"" as a rifled firearm with a barrel longer than 30 cm (12 in), and a total length longer than 60 cm (24 in). Single-shot, bolt-action, Martini-action, lever-action (also called under-lever action) and revolver rifles and carbines are permitted, with certificate, in any calibre. Self-loading (also known as semi-automatic) or pump-action rifles are only permitted in .22 rimfire calibre.

Pistols
The 1997 law did not ban pistols as such and was drafted in terms of small firearms. British law defines a ""pistol"" as a firearm with a barrel shorter than 30 cm (12 in) or a total length of less than 60 cm (24 in) (this definition encompasses revolvers, revolving pistols). Only muzzle-loading pistols—including muzzle-loading revolvers—are permitted; in practice all such firearms use black powder—a Class 1 explosive—as the propellant. Small quantities of muzzle-loading pistols and revolvers in various calibres, which comply with the regulations, are manufactured. All other pistols are mostly prohibited in Great Britain, with some exceptions such as pistols used for the humane dispatch of injured animals (such as deer) and some historical firearms.

This law created a new market for ""long-barrelled revolvers"" and ""long-barrelled pistols"", firearms with a permanently attached extension to the grip, making them long enough to fit under the legal definition of a rifle. Long-barrelled pistols in single-shot, or long-barrelled revolvers, both of any calibre, or semi-automatic in .22 rimfire, are all permitted with a Firearm Certificate.

Specific models of blank-firing starting pistol that are ""readily convertible"" to fire live ammunition may also be either banned or require a Firearm Certificate. The Bruni Olympic .380 BBM blank-firing revolver was banned in 2010 on evidence that it was being illegally converted.

Shotguns
Single-, double-, or triple-barrelled shotguns, or those with a lever-action, pump-action, or semi-automatic action and fixed magazine capacity of no more than 2 cartridges are permitted on a Shotgun Certificate as long as they meet the criteria of having a minimum barrel length of 24"", overall length of 40"", and a non-detachable magazine (if present). There's no limit on the number of guns or amount of ammunition that a Shotgun Certificate holder can acquire or possess at one time, although each shotgun must be recorded on the certificates. Cartridges obtained using a Shotgun Certificate must have at least 5 projectiles each with a maximum size of 0.36"". Other types of shotgun ammunition such as solid slugs can only be bought following the grant of an Firearm Certificate. Shotguns with a detachable magazine or larger fixed magazine are considered firearms and require a Section 1 Firearm Certificate (24"" rule and 40"" fixed overall length) or break action shotguns with a minimum 12"" barrel and overall 24"" fixed length.

Airguns
Airguns are firearms like any other according to the definition given in the Firearms Act 1968 at section 57(1). However, with the exception of Scotland where a certificate is now required, they are exempt from the requirement that a Firearm Certificate or Shotgun Certificate need be obtained to possess or acquire them provided that they meet certain limits as to their power. Air pistols with a muzzle energy not exceeding 6 foot-pounds force (8.1 joules) and other airguns with muzzle energy not exceeding 12 ft⋅lbf (16 J) do not require a certificate and may be acquired, purchased and possessed by anyone over the age of 18 and who is not a prohibited person as specified in section 21 of the Act which relates to persons previously convicted of a crime. The UK Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006 controls online or mail-order sales of airguns.

 ","England does not recognize a general constitutional or legal ""right to bear arms"" in the way that the United States does under its Second Amendment. Historically, the English Bill of Rights of 1689 granted Protestants the right to ""have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions and as allowed by Law"" [1][3][5]. However, this right was limited by class, religion, and legal regulation, and it was never a universal or unrestricted right [1][3][5].

Modern UK firearms law, including in England, is among the strictest in the world. Civilian ownership of firearms is heavily regulated and subject to licensing. While it is possible to legally own certain types of rifles and shotguns for purposes such as sport shooting or hunting, handguns are largely banned in Great Britain, and self-defense is not considered a valid reason for owning a firearm under UK law [2]. The law does allow for the use of a legally owned firearm in self-defense if the force used is deemed ""reasonable,"" but this is a narrow exception rather than a general right [2].

Legal scholars and historians continue to debate whether the 1689 Bill of Rights established an individual right to bear arms. Some, like Joyce Lee Malcolm, argue that it did and that this right influenced the American Second Amendment [1]. Others, such as Lois Schwoerer, contend that the right was limited and not intended as a broad individual entitlement [1].

In summary, while there is a historical precedent for a limited right to bear arms in England, it is not recognized today as a general or constitutional right. Instead, firearm ownership is tightly controlled by law and subject to strict licensing requirements [2][5].","[(0.3243240560785357, 1.0), (0.2702708738232947, 0.529551201011378), (0.16216202803926785, 0.8362831858407079), (0.0, 0.0), (0.2432430420589018, 0.8860619469026548)]","[(-0.03567593439547517, 0.0), (0.05693753731463158, 0.24485423131440825), (-0.051171308469395244, 0.06901045856798049), (0.0, 0.0), (0.029909705550238697, 0.11878921962992739)]"
